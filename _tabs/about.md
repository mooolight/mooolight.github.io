I'm just a random cybersecurity noob. With this blog, I want to share how I recreate publicly accessible papers and technical blogs about Pentesting, Red Teaming and Malware(Windows OS). With this blog, I hope I can help other people in case they come across the same problems that I did. 

Note: Please open issue(s) on my Github page for inaccuracies so I can correct it! Thank you!
