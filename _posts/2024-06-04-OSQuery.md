# Learning Objective

In this introductory room, the following learning objectives are covered:

- What is ***Osquery***, and what problem it solves?
- ***Osquery*** in Interactive Mode
- How to use the interactive mode of ***Osquery*** to interact with the operating system
- How to join two tables to get a single answer


-------
# OSQuery: Interactive Mode

`0.` Launching on powershell terminal:

```c
ps> osqueryi
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406022028.png)


`1.` Open the terminal and run:

```c
osqueryi
```


`2.` To understand the tool, run the `.help` command in the interactive terminal, as shown below:

```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help'

osquery> .help

```

**Note**: As per the documentation, meta-commands are prefixed with a `.`.


### List the tables

`3.` To list all the available tables that can be queried, use the `.tables` meta-command.

For example, if you wish to check what tables are associated with processes, you can use:

```c
.tables process
```


```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi 
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help' 

osquery> .table
=> appcompat_shims 
	=> arp_cache 
	=> atom_packages 
	=> authenticode 
	=> autoexec 
	=> azure_instance_metadata 
	=> azure_instance_tags 
	=> background_activities_moderator 
	=> bitlocker_info 
	=> carbon_black_info 
	=> carves 
	=> certificates 
	=> chassis_info 
	=> chocolatey_packages
```



`4.` To list all the tables with the term `user` in them, we will use `.tables user` as shown below:

```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help' 

osquery> .table user 
	=> user_groups 
	=> user_ssh_keys 
	=> userassist 
	=> users
```

In the above example, four tables are returned that contain the word **`user`**.


### Understanding the table Schema

`5.` Table names are not enough to know what information it contains without actually querying it. Knowledge of columns and types (known as a **`schema`** ) for each table is also helpful. 

We can list a table's schema with the following meta-command: `.schema table_name`

Here, we are interested in understanding the columns in the user's table.

```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi 
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help' 

osquery> .schema users 
CREATE TABLE users(`uid` BIGINT, `gid` BIGINT, `uid_signed` BIGINT, `gid_signed` BIGINT, `username` TEXT, `description` TEXT, `directory` TEXT, `shell` TEXT, `uuid` TEXT, `type` TEXT, `is_hidden` INTEGER HIDDEN, `pid_with_namespace` INTEGER HIDDEN, PRIMARY KEY (`uid`, `username`, `uuid`, `pid_with_namespace`)) 
WITHOUT ROWID;
```

<u>List of user parameters</u>:

```c
- uid
- gid
- uid_signed
- gid_signed
- username
- description
- directory
- shell
- uuid
- type
- is_hidden
- pid_with_namespace
```

The above result provides the column names like `username`, `description`, `PID` followed by respective datatypes like `BIGINT`, `TEXT`, `INTEGER`, etc. Let us pick a few columns from this schema and use SQL query to ask `osquery` to display the columns from the user table using the following syntax:

**SQL QUERY SYNTAX:** 

```c
select <column1>, <column2>, <column3> from table;
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406021507.png)


<u>From PowerShell</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406024902.png)


### Display Mode

`Osquery` comes with multiple display modes to select from. Use the `.help` option to list the available modes or choose 1 of them as shown below:

```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi 
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help' 

osquery> .help 

Welcome to the osquery shell. Please explore your OS! 
You are connected to a transient 'in-memory' virtual database. 
. 
. 
. 
.mode MODE Set output mode where MODE is one of: 
			csv Comma-separated values 
			column Left-aligned columns see .width 
			line One value per line 
			list Values delimited by .separator string 
			pretty Pretty printed SQL results (default) . . .
```


### Question and Answers section:

- How many tables are returned when we query "`table process`" in the interactive mode of Osquery?

```c
osquery> .table process
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406022156.png)

```c

# Schema Documentation

For this task, go to the schema [documentation](https://osquery.io/schema/5.5.1/) of `Osquery version 5.5.1`, the latest version. The schema documentation looks like the image shown below:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406025432.png)


### Breakdown  

Let's break down the important information we could find in this schema documentation:

`1.` A dropdown lists various versions of ***Osquery***. Choose the version of ***Osquery*** you wish to see schema tables for.

`2.` The number of tables within the selected version of ***Osquery***. (In the above image, 106 tables are available).

`3.` The list of tables is listed in alphabetical order for the selected version of ***Osquery***. This is the same result we get when we use the `.table` command in the interactive mode.  

`4.` The name of the table and a brief description.

`5.` A detailed chart showing each table's **column**, **type**, and **description**.

`6.` Information to which Operating System the table applies. (In the above image, the **`account_policy_data`** table is available only for **macOS**)

`7.` A dropdown menu to select the Operating System of choice. We can choose multiple Operating Systems, which will display the tables available for those Operating systems.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406025534.png)


# Question and Answer section:

- In `Osquery version 5.5.1`, how many common tables are returned, when we select both Linux and Window Operating system?

```c
56
```


- In `Osquery version 5.5.1`, how many tables for MAC OS are available?

```c
180
```


- In the Windows Operating system, which table is used to display the installed programs?

```c
programs
```


- In Windows Operating system, which column contains the registry value within the registry table?

```c
data
```



-----
# Creating SQL Queries

The SQL language implemented in Osquery is not an entire SQL language that you might be accustomed to, but rather it's a superset of SQLite. 

Realistically all your queries will start with a **`SELECT`** statement. This makes sense because, ***with Osquery, you are only querying information on an endpoint. You won't be updating or deleting any information/data on the endpoint.***

```c
**The exception to the rule**: Using other SQL statements, such as **UPDATE** and **DELETE,** is possible, but only if you''re creating run-time tables (views) or using an extension if the extension supports them. 
```

Your queries will also include a **FROM** clause and end with a **semicolon**.


### Exploring Installed Programs  

`1.` If you wish to retrieve all the information about the installed programs on the endpoint, first understand the table schema either using the `.schema programs` command in the interactive mode or use the documentation [here](https://osquery.io/schema/5.5.1/#programs).  

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406150656.png)

<u>List of the columns in 'programs'</u>:

```c
- name
- version
- install_location
- install_source
- language
- publisher
- uninstall_string
- install_date
- identifying_number
```


**Query:**

```c
SELECT * FROM programs LIMIT 1;
```

	- This shows the first entry in the 'programs' table.

<u>Output</u>:

```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi 
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help' 
osquery>select * from programs limit 1; 
	name = 7-Zip 21.07 (x64) 
	version = 21.07 
	install_location = C:\Program Files\7-Zip\ 
	install_source = 
	language = 
	publisher = Igor Pavlov 
	uninstall_string = "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\Uninstall.exe" 
	install_date = 
	identifying_number =
```


<u>In PowerShell</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406150922.png)


In the above example `LIMIT` was used followed by the number to limit the results to display.  

**Note**: Your results will be different if you run this query in the attached VM or your local machine (if ***Osquery*** is installed). Here line mode is used to display the result.


`2.` Selecting specific columns to display for an entry:

The number of columns returned might be more than what you need. You can select specific columns rather than retrieve every column in the table. 

**Query**: 

```c
SELECT name, version, install_location, install_date from programs limit 1;
```

```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi 
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help' 
osquery>select name, version, install_location, install_date from programs limit 1; 
	name = 7-Zip 21.07 (x64) 
	version = 21.07 
	install_location = C:\Program Files\7-Zip\ 
	install_date =
```

	- The above query will list the name, version, install location, and installed date of the programs on the endpoint. This will still return many results, depending on how busy the endpoint is.

<u>In PowerShell</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406151052.png)

	- Columns that weren't displayed:
		- language
		- publisher
		- uninstall_string
		- identifying_number


### Count  

`3.` To see how many programs or entries in any table are returned, we can use the **count()** function, as shown below:

**Query**:

```c
SELECT count(*) from programs;
```

Terminal Output:

```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help'
osquery>select count(*) from programs;
count(*) = 160
```


<u>In PowerShell</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406151405.png)


### WHERE Clause  

`4.` Optionally, you can use a **WHERE** clause to narrow down the list of results returned based on specified criteria. The following query will first get the user table and only display the result for the user `James`, as shown below:  

**Query**:

```c
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='James';
```


<u>Terminal Output</u>:

```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help'
osquery>SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='James';
        uid = 1002
        gid = 544
 uid_signed = 1002
 gid_signed = 544
   username = James
description =
  directory = C:\Users\James
      shell = C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe
       uuid = S-1-5-21-605937711-2036809076-574958819-1002
       type = local
```


<u>In PowerShell</u>: Getting the user entry for '`James`'

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406151640.png)


The equal sign is not the only filtering option in a **WHERE** clause. Below are filtering operators that can be used in a **WHERE** clause:

```c
- `=` [equal]
- `<>`  [not equal]
- `>`, `>=` [greater than, greater than, or equal to]
- `<`, `<=` [less than or less than or equal to] 
- `BETWEEN` [between a range]
- `LIKE` [pattern wildcard searches]
- `%` [wildcard, multiple characters]
- `_` [wildcard, one character]
```


### Matching Wildcard Rules  

Below is a screenshot from the Osquery [documentation](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/file-integrity-monitoring/) showing examples of using wildcards when used in folder structures:  (This is regex but replace "`*`" with "`%`")

- `%`: Match all files and folders for one level.
- `%%`: Match all files and folders recursively.
- `%abc`: Match all within-level ending in "abc".
- `abc%`: Match all within-level starting with "abc".

Matching Examples:
- `/Users/%/Library`: Monitor for changes to every user's Library folder, _but not the contents within_. 

		- Probably in terms of content size and permissions + ownerships?

- `/Users/%/Library/`: Monitor for changes to files _within_ each Library folder, but not the contents of their subdirectories.
- `/Users/%/Library/%`: Same, changes to files within each Library folder for every user.
- `/Users/%/Library/%%`: Monitor changes recursively within each Library. (including ALL subdirectories)
- `/bin/%sh`: Monitor the `bin` directory for changes ending in `sh`.


`5.` Some tables _require_ a **WHERE** clause, such as the **file** table, to return a value. If the required **WHERE** clause is not included in the query, then you will get an error.

```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help'
osquery>select * from file;
W1017 12:38:29.730041 45744 virtual_table.cpp:965] Table file was queried without a required column in the WHERE clause
W1017 12:38:29.730041 45744 virtual_table.cpp:976] Please see the table documentation: https://osquery.io/schema/#file
Error: constraint failed
```


<u>In PowerShell</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406152251.png)

	- Basically, OSQuery wants the user to be specific about the entry to be queried in the table.


### Joining Tables using JOIN Function

`6.` ***Table Union***: OSquery can also be used to join two tables based on a column that is shared by both tables. Let's look at two tables to demonstrate this further. Below is the schema for the **user's** table and the **processes** table. 


```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help'
osquery>.schema users
CREATE TABLE users(`uid` BIGINT, `gid` BIGINT, `uid_signed` BIGINT, `gid_signed` BIGINT, `username` TEXT, `description` TEXT, `directory` TEXT, `shell` TEXT, `uuid` TEXT, `type` TEXT, `is_hidden` INTEGER HIDDEN, `pid_with_namespace` INTEGER HIDDEN, PRIMARY KEY (`uid`, `username`, `uuid`, `pid_with_namespace`)) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

<u>In PowerShell</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406152939.png)


```c
osquery>.schema processes
CREATE TABLE processes(`pid` BIGINT, `name` TEXT, `path` TEXT, `cmdline` TEXT, `state` TEXT, `cwd` TEXT, `root` TEXT, `uid` BIGINT, `gid` BIGINT, `euid` BIGINT, `egid` BIGINT, `suid` BIGINT, `sgid` BIGINT, `on_disk` INTEGER, `wired_size` BIGINT, `resident_size` BIGINT, `total_size` BIGINT, `user_time` BIGINT, `system_time` BIGINT, `disk_bytes_read` BIGINT, `disk_bytes_written` BIGINT, `start_time` BIGINT, `parent` BIGINT, `pgroup` BIGINT, `threads` INTEGER, `nice` INTEGER, `elevated_token` INTEGER, `secure_process` INTEGER, `protection_type` TEXT, `virtual_process` INTEGER, `elapsed_time` BIGINT, `handle_count` BIGINT, `percent_processor_time` BIGINT, `upid` BIGINT HIDDEN, `uppid` BIGINT HIDDEN, `cpu_type` INTEGER HIDDEN, `cpu_subtype` INTEGER HIDDEN, `translated` INTEGER HIDDEN, `cgroup_path` TEXT HIDDEN, `phys_footprint` BIGINT HIDDEN, PRIMARY KEY (`pid`)) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

<u>In PowerShell</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406153015.png)


Looking at both schemas, `uid` in `users` table is meant to identify the `user record`, and in the `processes table`, the column `uid` represents the user responsible for executing the particular process. We can join both tables using this `uid` field as shown below:

**Query1:** 

```c
select uid, pid, name, path from processes;
```

<u>PS Output:</u>

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406153128.png)

`...`

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406153146.png)


**Query2:**

```c
select uid, username, description from users;
```

<u>PS Output:</u>

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406153250.png)

	- Enumerate all the users in the endpoint


**Joined Query:**

```c
select p.pid, p.name, p.path, u.username from processes p JOIN users u on u.uid=p.uid LIMIT 10;
```  

<u>PS Output</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406153349.png)

	- Enumerate all the processes running under the user "James" along with their PIDs.


<u>Terminal Output</u>:

```c
root@analyst$ osqueryi
Using a virtual database. Need help, type '.help'
osquery>select p.pid, p.name, p.path, u.username from processes p JOIN users u on u.uid=p.uid LIMIT 10;

# Challenge and Conclusion

- Which table stores the evidence of process execution in Windows OS?

```c
userassist
```

Check `userassist` table:

```c
osquery>.schema userassist
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406160140.png)


Query all entries in `userassist` table:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406160245.png)


- One of the users seems to have executed a program to `remove traces from the disk`; what is the name of that program?

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406160423.png)

```c
diskwipe.exe
```


- Create a search query to identify the VPN installed on this host. What is name of the software?

```c
SELECT * FROM userassist where path ILIKE "%vpn%"
```

PS Output:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406160745.png)

	- Seems like OSQuery is already case insensitive


- How many services are running on this host?

<u>Command</u>:

```c
osquery>.schema services
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406160855.png)

```c
SELECT count(*) from services;
```

<u>Output</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406161006.png)

<u>One of the services running</u>:

```c
osquery> SELECT name,service_type,display_name,status,pid,path,module_path,description from services LIMIT 1;
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406161119.png)


- A table **`autoexec`** contains the list of executables that are automatically executed on the target machine. There seems to be a batch file that runs automatically. What is the name of that batch file (with the extension `.bat`)?

<u>Command</u>:

```c
osquery>.schema autoexec
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406161256.png)

```c
osquery> SELECT * from autoexec where path LIKE "%.bat%";
```

<u>PS Output</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240406161702.png)

- What is the full path of the batch file found in the above question? (Last in the List)

```c
- C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\batstartup.bat
- C:\Users\James\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\batstartup.bat
```
