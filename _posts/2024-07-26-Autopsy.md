# Intro

### What is Autopsy?
`Autopsy` is an open-source and powerful digital forensics platform. Several features within Autopsy have been developed by the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology funding. You can read more about this here. 
The official description: "Autopsy is the premier open source forensics platform which is fast, easy-to-use, and capable of analysing all types of mobile devices and digital media. Its plug-in architecture enables extensibility from community-developed or custom-built modules. Autopsy evolves to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of professionals in law enforcement, national security, litigation support, and corporate investigation."

This room's objective is to provide an overview of using the Autopsy tool to analyse disk images. The assumption is that you are familiar with the Windows operating system and Windows artefacts in relation to forensics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Workflow Overview and Case Analysis

### Workflow Overview
Before diving into Autopsy and analysing data, there are a few steps to perform; such as identifying the data source and what Autopsy actions to perform with the data source. 

<u>Basic workflow</u>:
```c
- Create/open the case for the data source you will investigate
- Select the data source you wish to analyse
- Configure the ingest modules to extract specific artefacts from the data source
- Review the artefacts extracted by the ingest modules
- Create the report
```


# Case Analysis | (a) Create a New Case
To prepare a new case investigation, you need to create a case file from the data source. When you start Autopsy, there will be three options. You can create a new case file using the "New Case" option. Once you click on the "New Case" option, the Case Information menu opens, where information about the case is populated.

- Case Name: The name you wish to give to the case
- Base Directory: The root directory that will store all the files specific to the case (the full path will be displayed)
- Case Type: Specify whether this case will be local (Single-user) or hosted on a server where multiple analysts can review 

(Multi-user)
Note: In this room, the focus is on Single-User. Also, the room doesn't simulate a new case creation, and the given VM has a sample case file to practice covered Autopsy features.
The following screen is titled "Optional Information" and can be left blank for our purposes. In an actual forensic environment, you should fill out this information. Once you click on "Finish", Autopsy will create a new case file from the given data source.

# Case Analysis | Open an Existing Case

The Autopsy can also open prebuilt case files. Note that supported data sources are discussed in the next task. This part aims to show how to create/open case files with Autopsy.

***Note***: Autopsy case files have a "`.aut`" file extension.

In this room, you will import a case. To open a case, select the "`Open Case`" option. Navigate to the case folder (located on the desktop) and select the `.aut` file you wish to open. Next, Autopsy will process the case files and open the case. You can identify the name of the case at the top left corner of the Autopsy window. In the image below, the name of this case is "`Sample Case`". 

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160043.png)


![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160055.png)


***Note***: A warning box will appear if Autopsy cannot locate the disk image. At this point, you can point to the location of the disk image it's attempting to find, or you can click NO; you can still analyse the data from the `Autopsy` case.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160127.png)

Once the case you wish to analyse is open, you are ready to start exploring the data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Data Sources

### Data Sources

Autopsy can analyse multiple disk image formats. Before diving into the data analysis step, let's briefly cover the different data sources Autopsy can analyse. You can add data sources by using the "`Add Data Source`" button. Available options are shown in the picture below.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160213.png)

We will focus primarily on the Disk Image or VM File option in this room. 

<u>Supported Disk Image Formats</u>:
```c
- Raw Single (For example: *.img, *.dd, *.raw, *.bin)
- Raw Split (For example: *.001, *.002, *.aa, *.ab, etc)
- EnCase (For example: *.e01, *.e02, etc)
- Virtual Machines (For example: *.vmdk, *.vhd)
```

If there are multiple image files (e.i. E01, E02, E03, etc.) Autopsy only needs you to point to the first image file, and Autopsy will handle the rest.  
Note: Refer to the Autopsy documentation to understand the other data sources that can be added to a case. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Ingest Modules

Essentially Ingest Modules are Autopsy plug-ins. Each Ingest Module is designed to analyse and retrieve specific data from the drive. You can configure Autopsy to run specific modules during the source-adding stage or later by choosing the target data source available on the dashboard. By default, the ***Ingest Modules*** are configured to run on All Files, Directories, and Unallocated Space. You can change this setting during the module selecting step. You can track the process with the bar appearing in the lower right corner.
The below screenshots simulate mentioned two different approaches to using ingest modules. Note that using ingest modules requires time to implement. Therefore we will not cover ingest modules in this room.

***Note***: Autopsy adds metadata about files to the local database, not the actual file contents. 

Configuring ingest modules while adding data sources:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160342.png)


Using ingest modules after adding data sources:
```c
- Open the “Run Ingest Modules” menu by right-clicking on the data source.
- Choose the modules to implement and click on the finish button.
- Track the progress of implementation.
```


![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160419.png)


The results of any ***Ingest Module*** you select to run against a data source will populate the Results node in the Tree view, which is the left pane of the Autopsy user interface. Below is an example of using the “`Interesting Files Identifier`” ingest module. Note that the results depend on the dataset. If you choose a module to retrieve specific data that is unavailable in the drive, there will be no results.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160508.png)

Drawing the attention back to the ***Configure Ingest Modules*** window, notice that some Ingest Modules have per-run settings and some do not. 

<u>Example</u>:
The Keyword Search Ingest Module does not have per-run settings. In contrast, the Interesting Files Finder Ingest Module does. The yellow triangle represents the “`per-run settings option`”.

As ***Ingest Modules*** run, alerts may appear in the Ingest Inbox. Below is an example of the Ingest Inbox after a few Ingest Modules have completed running.

# The User Interface I

Let's look at the Autopsy user interface, which is comprised of 5 primary areas: 

### Tree Viewer

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160656.png)


##### The Tree Viewer has five top-level nodes:
```c
- Data Sources : all the data will be organised as you would typically see it in a normal Windows File Explorer. 
- Views : files will be organised based on file types, MIME types, file size, etc. 
- Results : as mentioned earlier, this is where the results from Ingest Modules will appear. 
- Tags : will display files and/or results that have been tagged (read more about tagging ⦁	here).
- Reports : will display reports either generated by modules or the analyst (read more about reporting here).
```

Refer to the Autopsy documentation on the Tree Viewer for more information here. 

### Result Viewer

***Note***: Don't confuse the Results node (from the Tree Viewer) with the Result Viewer. 

When a volume, file, folder, etc., is selected from the Tree Viewer, additional information about the selected item is displayed in the Result Viewer. For example, the Sample case's data source is selected, and now additional information is visible in the Results Viewer.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160817.png)


If a volume is selected, the Result Viewer's information will change to reflect the information in the local database for the selected volume.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160839.png)


Notice that the Result Viewer pane has three tabs: `Table`, `Thumbnail`, and `Summary`. The above screenshots reflect the information displayed in the Table tab. The Thumbnail tab works best with image or video files. If the view of the above data is changed from Table to Thumbnail, not much information will be displayed. See below:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160911.png)


Volume nodes can be expanded, and an analyst can navigate the volume's contents like a typical Windows system:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726160934.png)


In the ***Views*** tree node, files are categorised by File Types - `By Extension`, `By MIME Type`, `Deleted Files`, and `By File Size`:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726161012.png)


***`Tip`***: When it comes to File Types, pay attention to this section. An adversary can rename a file with a misleading file extension. So the file will be '`miscategorised`'  By Extension but will be categorised appropriately by `MIME` Type. Expand ‘`By Extension`’ and more children nodes appear, categorising files even further (see below).

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726162718.png)

	- Refer to the Autopsy documentation on the Result Viewer for more information here. 


### Contents Viewer

From the Table tab in the Result Viewer, if you click any folder/file, additional information is displayed in the Contents Viewer pane.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726162748.png)


In the given image, three columns might not be quickly understood what they represent.

```c
- S = Score: The Score will show a red exclamation point for a folder/file marked/tagged as notable and a yellow triangle pointing downward for a folder/file marked/tagged as suspicious. These items can be marked/tagged by an Ingest Module or the analyst.
- C = Comment: If a yellow page is visible in the Comment column, it will indicate that there is a comment for the folder/file.
- O = Occurrence: In a nutshell, this column will indicate how many times this file/folder has been seen in past cases (this will require the Central Repository)
```

	- Refer to the Autopsy documentation on the Contents Viewer for more information here. 


##### Keyword Search

At the top right, you will find `Keyword Lists` and `Keyword Search`. With Keyword Search, an analyst can perform an AD-HOC keyword search.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726162908.png)


In the image above, the analyst searches for the word '`secret`.' Below are the search results.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726162928.png)


Refer to the Autopsy documentation for more information on performing keyword searches with either option.


### Status Area

Lastly, the Status Area is at the bottom right. When Ingest Modules run, a progress bar (along with the percentage completed) will be displayed in this area. More detailed information regarding the `Ingest Modules` is provided if you click on the bar.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726163009.png)

If the X (directly next to the progress bar) is clicked, a prompt will appear confirming if you wish to end/cancel the Ingest Modules.
Refer to the Autopsy documentation on the UI overview here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The User Interface II

Let's look at where we can find summarised info with ease. Summarised info can help analysts decide where to focus by evaluating available artefacts. It is suggested to view the summary of the data sources before starting an investigation. Therefore you can have a general idea about the system and artefacts.

### Data Sources Summary

The Data Sources Summary provides summarised info in nine different categories. Note that this is an overview of the total findings. If you want to dive deep into the findings and look for a specific artefact, you need to analyse each module separately using the "Result Viewer" shown in the previous task.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726163208.png)


# Generate Report

You can create a report of your findings in multiple formats, enabling you to create data sheets for your investigation case. The report provides all information listed under the "Result Viewer" pane. Reports can help you to re-investigate findings after finishing the live investigation. However, reports don't have additional search options, so you must manually find artefacts for the event of interest.

`Tip`: The Autopsy tool can be heavy for systems with low resources. Therefore completing an investigation with Autopsy on low resources can be slow and painful. Especially browsing long results might end up with a system freeze. You can avoid that situation by using reports. You can use the tool for parsing the data and generating the report, then continue to analyse through the generated report without a need for Autopsy. Note that it is always easier to conduct and manage an investigation with the GUI.

You can use the "`Generate Report`" option to create reports. The steps are shown below.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726163304.png)


<u>Directory where the report will be stored</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726163326.png)


<u>Report viewed from a browser</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726163349.png)


Once you choose your report format and scope, Autopsy will generate the report. You can click on the “HTML Report” section (shown above) to view the report on your browser. Reports contain all of the “Result Viewer” pane results on the left side.

# Data Analysis

***Mini Scenario***: An employee was suspected of leaking company data. A disk image was retrieved from the machine. You were assigned to perform the initial analysis. Further action will be determined based on the initial findings.

***Reminder***: Since the actual disk image is not in the attached VM, certain Autopsy sections will not display any actual data, only the metadata for that row within the local database. You can click No when you're notified about the 'Missing Image.' Additionally, you do not need to run any ingest modules in this exercise.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Visualization Tools

You may have noticed that other parts of the user interface weren't discussed as of yet. 
 
![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164046.png)

Please refer to the Autopsy documentation for the following visualisation tool:
```c
- Images/Videos: http://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/4.12.0/image_gallery_page.html
- Communications: http://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/4.12.0/communications_page.html
- Timeline: http://sleuthkit.org/autopsy/docs/user-docs/4.12.0/timeline_page.html
```

Note: Within the attached VM, you will NOT be able to practice with some of the visualisation tools, except for Timeline. Below is a screenshot of the Timeline.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164113.png)


The Timeline tool is composed of three areas:
```c
- Filters: Narrow the events displayed based on the filter criteria
- Events: The events are displayed here based on the View Mode
- Files/Contents: Additional information on the event(s) is displayed in this area

There are three view modes:
- Counts: The number of events is displayed in a bar chart view
- Details: Information on events is displayed, but they are clustered and collapsed, so the UI is not overloaded
- List: The events are displayed in a table view
```

In the above screenshot, the View Mode is `Counts`. Below is a screenshot of the Details View Mode.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164149.png)


The numbers (seen above) indicate the number of clustered/collapsed events for a specific time frame. For example, for /Windows, there are 130,257 events between `2009–06–10` and `2010–03–18`. See the below image.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164214.png)


To expand a cluster, click on the green icon with the plus sign. See the below example.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164231.png)


To collapse the events, click on the red icon with a minus sign. Click the map marker icon with a plus sign if you wish to pin a group of events. This will move (pin) the events to an isolated section of the Events view.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164302.png)


To unpin the events, click on the map marker with the minus sign. The last group of icons to cover are the eye icons. If you wish to hide a group of events from the Events view, click on the eye with a minus sign. 

In the below screenshot, the clustered events for `/Boot` were hidden and placed in ***`Hidden Descriptions`*** (in the Filters area).

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164329.png)


If you wish to reverse that action and unhide the events, right-click and select `Unhide` and remove from list. See the below example.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164347.png)


Last but not least, a screenshot of the List View Mode is below.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164404.png)

	- This should be enough information to get you started interacting with the Timeline with some level of confidence.


### Questions:
- Using the Timeline, how many results were there on `2015-01-12`?

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164443.png)

-> Answer: 46


- The majority of file events occurred on what date? (MONTH DD, YYYY)

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164519.png)


![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726164529.png)


To conclude, there is more to Autopsy that wasn't covered in detail within this room. Below are some topics that you should explore on your own to configure Autopsy to do more out of the box:
```c
- Global Hash Lookup Settings
- Global File Extension Mismatch Identification Settings
- Global Keyword Search Settings
- Global Interesting Items Settings
- Yara Analyser
```

3rd Party modules are available for Autopsy. Visit the official SleuthKit GitHub repo for a list of 3rd party modules here. The disk image used with this room's development was created and released by the NIST under the Computer Forensic Reference Data Sets (CFReDS) Project. It is encouraged to download the disk image, go through the full exercise (here) to practice using Autopsy, and level up your investigation techniques. 
Now, we invite you to complete the Autopsy challenge room: Disk Analysis & Autopsy.
