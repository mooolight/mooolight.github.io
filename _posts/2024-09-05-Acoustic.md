# Scenario

This lab takes you into the world of voice communications on the internet. VoIP is becoming the de-facto standard for voice communication. As this technology becomes more common, malicious parties have more opportunities and stronger motives to control these systems to conduct nefarious activities. This challenge was designed to examine and explore some of the attributes of the `SIP` and `RTP` protocols.


### Hypothesis:
- In this lab, it might show how attackers utilize VoIP systems to impersonate the PBX systems in an organization to conduct calls and probably vishing attacks as the calls will be traced on the compromised organization.

#### Lab Files:

```c
- "log.txt" was generated from an unadvertised, passive honeypot located on the internet such that any traffic destined to it must be nefarious. Unknown parties scanned the honeypot with a range of tools, and this activity is represented in the log file.
    - The IP address of the honeypot has been changed to "honey.pot.IP.removed". In terms of geolocation, pick your favorite city.
    - The MD5 hash in the authorization digest is replaced with "MD5_hash_removedXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    - Some octets of external IP addresses have been replaced with an "X"
    - Several trailing digits of phone numbers have been replaced with an "X"
    - Assume the timestamps in the log files are UTC.

- "Voip-trace.pcap" was created by honeynet members for this forensic challenge to allow participants to employ network analysis skills in the VOIP context.
```

As a soc analyst, analyze the artifacts and answer the questions.

# Before we go to the questions, let's study how the SIP protocol works!


# What is Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)? (How VoIP works)

- SIP allows for creation of the backbone needed for two endpoints to communicate to one another. It uses `proxy servers` as placeholder for communicating endpoints as a way to relay the signals each endpoint want to send.

<u>Steps for SIP</u>:
```c
1) Establish,
2) Modify and
3) Terminate

multimedia sessions
```

<u>How SIP operates</u>:
```c
- 'User location' : which user endpoint wants to communicate
- 'User availability' : does the endpoint want to communicate
- 'User capabilities' : what medium is used to make it possible for endpoints to communicate
- 'Session setup' : what are the prerequisites needed for both communicating parties to talk to each other
- 'Session management' : how does the two communicating parties know when to start, still talk and/or end the communication
```

##### What kind of security features do SIP have?
```c
- DOS prevention
- User Authentication (user and proxy to user)
- Integrity protection
- Encryption
- Privacy services
```

##### Basic functions provided by SIP
`1)` Location of an endpoint
`2)` Signal of a desire to communicate
`3)` Negotiation of session parameters to establish the session
`4)` Teardown of the session once established.


# The SIP model

- Uses `HTTP-like request/response`: the SIP uses expects multiple interaction from the endpoints and their respective proxy servers to allow proper communication. It is http-like because it also use a 3-way handshake for establishing a session for communicating endpoints.

First step for SIP from the sender endpoint:
```c
1) Alice''s softphone sending an INVITE request addressed to Bob''s SIP URI
```


Reference for the rest of the SIP request methods:

| Request name | Description                                                                  | Defined in |

| MESSAGE      | Transports instant messages using SIP.                                       | RFC 3428   |
| UPDATE       | Modifies the state of a session without changing the state of the dialogue.  | RFC 3311   |

##### Are there more secure version of this protocol?

- Yes! it utilizes the use of TLS to envelope it with encryption.

Secured SIP URI: (example)
```c
sips:bob@biloxi.com
```

	- Encrypted with TLS

```

	- Notice the prerequisite nodes in the infrastructure:
		- DNS
		- Location Service


##### Examples of SIP URI:
```c
sip:bob@biloxi.com
sip:alice@atlanta.com

Breakdown:
- biloxi.com -> domain
- atlanta.com -> domain

Format:
<username>@<domain>
```

***INVITE*** header fields breakdown:
```c
- 'Via' : this displays the full domain of the proxy server to which the INVITE-ing endpoint should receive a response. 'branch' is used for transaction identification.
- 'Max-Forwards' : 
- 'To/From' : communicating parties
- 'Call-ID' : a globally unique ID for this call containing a random string and the softphone''s hostname + IP address. (Can you derive the hostname and IP address using the Call-ID?)
- 'CSeq' : integer + method name (INVITE in this case)
- 'Contact' : contains the username concatenated with the FQDN of the proxy server that relays the response. If FQDN is not used, the IP address will be. This basically tells whoever is communicating with this user that sent the 'INVITE' to send the response to this user at this FQDN/IP address.
- 'Content-Type' : description of message body
- 'Content-Length' : count of the message body
```

##### INVITE request breakdown:
```c
- '100 (Trying)' : indicates that the INVITE has been received and that the proxy is working on the endpoint''s behalf to route to the destination/intended recipient.

- 'INVITE F1' : Endpoint sends the INVITE request to its nearest proxy
- 'INVITE F2' : proxy sends the INVITE request to the destination endpoint''s proxy server by figuring its IP address most through DNS.
- '100 Trying F3' : the INVITE has been received and that the proxy is working on its behalf to route the INVITE to the destination.
		- Responses: uses three-digit code followed by descriptive phrases
			- What it contains:
				- To
				- From
				- Call-ID
				- CSeq
				- Branch param from via (remember this value is unique in the transaction)

- 'INVITE F4' : What happens in the middle of 'F3' and 'F4'?
		-> the receiving end of INVITE request''s proxy server asks a 'location service' to ask for the receiving endpoint''s IP address, adds its own address to the INVITE request on the endpoint so the receiving endpoint knows which proxy server to send the response back.

- '100 Trying F5' : 
- '180 Ringing F6' : endpoint receives the INVITE request and alerts that an incoming call from the sendee endpoint so the receiving endpoint can decide whether to answer the call (receiving endpoint''s phone rings).
- '180 Ringing F7' : sends the phone ringing to the sendee of the INVITE request
- '180 Ringing F8' : sends the phone ringing to the sendee of the INVITE request. Once the sendee endpoint gets a feedback that the receiving endpoint''s phone is ringing, it displays on the sendee endpoint''s phone that receiving endpoint''s phone (INVITE) matches with it. 
- '200 OK F9' : when the receiving endpoint''s phone decided to answer the phone call, it sends a '200 OK' from the answering endpoint to the nearest proxy

- '200 OK F10' : answering proxy tells calling proxy that the answering endpoint decide to pick up the call
- '200 OK F11' : calling proxy tells the calling endpoint that its call is being picked up 
```


##### Question: What is Session Description Protocol (`SDP`)?
-> Answer: contains the description of the session which is found in the body of the `SIP` message and is used to encode this description.


Example diagram:
```c
	SIP
--------------
| Body        |
|-------------|
||  SDP-enc  ||
|-------------|
|             |
---------------
```

	- In Wireshark, the protocol should be 'SIP/SDP'.  This is mostly for response.
	- It should contain the:
		- Owner username
		- Session ID
		- Session version
		- Owner Network Type
		- Owner Address Type
		- etc.
	- SDP contains the media information of the communication endpoints


<u>200 OK from Bob:</u>
```c
SIP/2.0 200 OK
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP server10.biloxi.com ;branch=z9hG4bKnashds8;received=192.0.2.3
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP bigbox3.site3.atlanta.com ;branch=z9hG4bK77ef4c2312983.1;received=192.0.2.2
Via: SIP/2.0/UDP pc33.atlanta.com ;branch=z9hG4bK776asdhds ;received=192.0.2.1
To: Bob <sip:bob@biloxi.com>;tag=a6c85cf
From: Alice <sip:alice@atlanta.com>;tag=1928301774
Call-ID: a84b4c76e66710@pc33.atlanta.com
CSeq: 314159 INVITE
Contact: <sip:bob@192.0.2.4>
Content-Type: application/sdp
Content-Length: 131

(Bob''s SDP not shown)
```

	- The 'Via' part were copied from the INVITE request the sender endpoint has sent to receiver endpoint
	- 'pc33.atlanta.com' => added by the sender endpoint's softphone
	- 'bigbox3.atlanta.com' => added by the sender endpoint's proxy server on the packet header
	- 'server10.biloxi.com' => added by the receiving endpoint''s proxy server


##### INVITE request breakdown Cont'd:
```c
- 'ACK F12' : sender''s endpoint will send the ACK response to the receiver from it''s softphone to the receiver''s softphone DIRECTLY bypassing the proxy servers. This was made possible due to the known address from the 'Contact' header fields through the 'INVITE/200 (OK)' exchange.
```

- Imagine that the medium use for the endpoints to communicate is now built just like how two people who wants to talk to each other has to create an environment with the right atmosphere so when they talk to each other, they could actually hear what the other person is saying.

# Start of media session with Session Description Protocol (SDP)

- The endpoints communication occurs in here. If they want to change the medium used for communication, they can send a '`Re-INVITE`'.
- Also note that despite not needing the proxy once the endpoint knows each other's address, the proxies can still remain on the path in between the communicating endpoints like a man-in-the-middle.

# Ending the call

- In a normal phone conversation, both parties say goodbye to each other and hangs up the phone. Let's zoom in on that.
- What happens when the first endpoint hung up during a call is that it generates a **`BYE`** message and is confirm on the other end with a '`200 OK`' response without having the need for an "**`ACK`**".

		- Note that an ACK is only sent after the response to the INVITE request was accepted by the sender of the INVITE.


----
# Exploring other operation in SIP

### `Registration`

- `Registration` is one way that an endpoint's proxy server can learn the current location of its endpoint.
- Basically, this allows the binding of the softphone to be bound with a proxy server so on the moment that the softphone is expecting a call or needing to call someone else, it knows where to relay it to.
- `Authorization` and `Authentication` are not covered in the `REGISTER` request but by challenge/response mechanism.
##### Location Service

- A concept that allows proxy servers to send or receive URIs to endpoints whether it is for sending or receiving a request.


# Structure of Session Initiation Protocol

```c
1) 'Syntax and Encoding' which is its message (SDP)
2) 'Transport layer' : how the endpoint and server sends and receives requests on a network
3) 'Transaction layer' : the medium to which the transactions are made in a SIP. It is a fundamental component of the Session Initiation Protocol.
4) 'Transaction User' : a node in the network that is NOT stateless and is required to create a client transaction instance passing the request including the destination iP address and port to send the request
```

##### What are the SIP elements?
```c
- User Agent clients and Servers
- Stateless and Stateful proxies and registrars
```


##### Interaction between SIP elements

- `Dialog` : its a way for clients to interact with one another with some duration.
- `Session` : created with the INVITE method. Session is a way to tell endpoints that they are communicating right now and using this medium.

Example session with SDP:
```c
- SDP username
- Session ID
- Network Type
- Address Type
- Address elements in the origin field
```

# Questions:

## `Q1`: What is the transport protocol being used?

Querying the capabilities of the server:
![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726122515.png)



The protocols we need are under the UDP:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240725220350.png)

-> Answer: `UDP`


## `Q2`: The attacker used a bunch of scanning tools that belong to the same suite. Provide the name of the suite.

Who's the attacker and the victim?

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240725143410.png)


### Structure:

```c
Attacker''s IP: 172.25.105.43 (adversary''s initial access) -> PBX system on the network
Victim''s IP: 172.25.105.40 -> Apache SIP proxy server
```

	- Hypothesis: there's a way to move laterally from 172.25.105.43 to 172.25.105.40 with the SIP protocol.


###### Software used on the SIP proxy server for PBX implementation:

<u>Local domain</u>:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726125631.png)


Focusing on the network connections coming from the attacker:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240725220902.png)

	- This is PROBABLY the attacker using the 'svmap' sub-tool from the Sipvicious.
	- I think this is more like Gobuster?


##### Authentication that happens on the server:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726123746.png)


**Note**: The scan happens in `TCP/HTTP`.

##### Checking the server's capabilities:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726122653.png)

-> Answer: `sipvicious`

Link to open-source software: `https://github.com/EnableSecurity/sipvicious`

##### General usage for `sipvicious`:

```c
1) svmap -> used to find the endpoint that is using PBX

[you@box sipvicious]$ ./svmap 192.168.1.1/24

+--------------------+--------------+
| SIP Device         | User Agent   |
-------------------------------------
| 192.168.1.103:5060 | Asterisk PBX |
+--------------------+--------------+


2) svwar -> used to enumerate the extensions available on the said endpoint using PBX

[you@box sipvicious]$ ./svwar 192.168.1.103

+-----------+----------------+
| Extension | Authentication |
------------------------------
| 123       | reqauth        |
| 100       | reqauth        |
| 101       | noauth         |
+-----------+----------------+


3) svcrack -> cracking the password for extensions that DOES require password:

[you@box sipvicious]$ ./svcrack 192.168.1.103 -u 100 (uses default .txt passwords I guess)

+-----------+----------+
| Extension | Password |
------------------------
| 100       | 100      |
+-----------+----------+


-> For using a customized dictionary file:

[you@box sipvicious]$ ./svcrack 192.168.1.103 -u 123 -d dictionary.txt

+-----------+----------+
| Extension | Password |
------------------------
| 123       | secret   |
+-----------+----------+


4) Following that, you can make use of the credentials by making use of a SIP softphone of your choice.
```

	- Reference: https://github.com/enablesecurity/sipvicious/wiki/Getting-Started


#### Flow:
```c
svmap -> svwar -> svcrack -> attacker compromises the PBX systems allowing phone system impersonation?
```

- Case study: https://www.rtcsec.com/post/2010/12/11-million-euro-loss-in-voip-fraud-and/


Sub-tools inside `sipvicious`:
```c
- 'svmap' : sip scanner. When launched against ranges of IP address space, it will identify any SIP servers which it finds on the way. Also has the option to scan hosts on ranges of ports.
- 'svwar' : identifies working extension lines on a PBX. A working extension is one that can be registered. Also tells you if the extension line requires authentication or not.
- 'svcrack' : a password cracker making use of digest authentication. It is able to crack passwords on both registrar servers and proxy servers. Current cracking modes are either numeric ranges or words from dictionary files.
- 'svreport' : able to managesessions created by the rest of the tools and export to pdf, xml, csv and plaintext.
- 'svcrash' : responds to svwar and svcrack SIP messages with a message that causes old version to crash
```


## `Q3`: What is the `User-Agent` of the victim system?

Shows that this is VoIP:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240725221312.png)

-> Answer: `Asterisk PBX 1.6.0.10-FONCORE-r40`


What is PBX?
-> a telephone system that allows extension phones in one office to connect to the telephone network in another office. Basically a way to network different telephone networks.


## `Q4`:  Which tool was only used against the following extensions: `100`,`101`,`102`,`103`, and `111`? (This is found in the `log.txt` file)

Clues: let's try to filter on the packets using the `SIP` protocol first and `statistics` on it

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240725224439.png)


***SIP requests***:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240725224508.png)


##### Attacker finding a target on the network after running `svmap`: (Note that you should see a response coming from the target machine but on source port `5060` or `5061 (TLS)` which is in UDP and NOT in TCP.)

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726105006.png)

	- Which SIP request are used when using 'svmap' subtool?


***Note that there is only extensions `100`, `555` and `1000` in the Wireshark pcap***.

Digging into this stream:
```c
Sequence of methods used by attacker:
1) REGISTER ['request'] <-> SIP/2.0 200 OK ['response'] : attacker impersonates the extension assuming it has its credentials (for authentication)
2) SUBSCRIBE ['request'] <-> SIP/2.0 404 Not found (no mailbox) ['response'] : for subscribing on a mailbox (in the case below, it doesn''t have one)
3) INVITE ['request'] <-> SIP/2.0 100 Trying then SIP/2.0 200 OK ['response'] : invite an endpoint to a call
4) ACK ['request'] : acknowledges the phone call about to start

<phone-call happens here as describe in the RFC 3261>

5) BYE : ends the phone call
```


Successful impersonation of extension `555`: (Goal: find the packets that show how the credentials for extension `555` was extracted using `sipvicious`)

##### Showing how the credentials for extension `555` was extracted:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726124124.png)

	- Found the password on the webserver for extension '555'.
	- How does this indicate its 'svcrack' that was used for it?


Found in the `sip_custom.conf` file which is widely used in PBX systems:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726130911.png)


-> Answer: `svcrack`

<u>Sub-questions</u>:
```c
- How exactly is the svcrack.py subtool used on these extensions? Is it via HTTP? UDP?
```


##### Checking all other `HTTP 200 OK` response:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726124719.png)


Saving all the responses on a file: `File > Export Objects > HTTP`

<u>Query used</u>:

```c
http.response.code == 200
```

## `Q5`: Which extension on the honeypot does NOT require authentication?

For this one, try to parse the extensions that was accepted immediately:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240726135042.png)

If you look up the string `Authorization`, you will NOT get the username `100` from the list of extensions: `100,101,102,103` and `111`.

-> Answer: `100`


## `Q6`: How many extensions were scanned in total?

What do we know about the scan?

```c
- What tools was used for scanning: 'sipvicious'
- Is there something specific about this tool on the packet capture? : 'User-Agent: friendly-scanner' at sixth line for each block
- What about the extensions? -> It seems to be a number from 100 -> a four digit number 9999 probably
- What about the destination? -> It should be the honeypot
- Contact line also contains the caller ID''s extension -> since the extension exists on lines 'Contact' and 'Request(INVITE,SUBSCRIBE,etc.)' line, we want to avoid duplication by grepping on the 'Contact' part only.
```

<u>Query</u>:

```c
cat log.txt | grep 'User-Agent: friendly-scanner' -A2 | grep -i 'honey' | grep -v Contact | uniq | wc -l
```

	- It will output 2657. However, on the last 5 lines, it will duplicate for extensions 100,101,102,103,and 111

-> Answer: `2652`

## `Q7`: There is a trace for a real SIP client. What is the corresponding user-agent? (two words, once space in between)

Parse the `log.txt` file using grep:

```c
grep -Ei 'User-Agent:' log.txt | uniq
```

	- This will output all User-Agents found.


Output:
```c
User-Agent: friendly-scanner
User-Agent: Zoiper rev.6751
```

	- Notice that this User agent relates to the actual VoIP that was used to impersonate the user of the given extension and make phone calls on their behalf through the PBX system. It essentially uses the victim''s phone number by the attacker on behalf of the victim.
	- Actual calls for impersonation uses the Zoiper softphone. This is a free VoIP softphone.


-> Answer: `Zoiper rev.6751`


## `Q8`: Multiple real-world phone numbers were dialed. What was the most recent 11-digit number dialed from extension 101?

-> First, find the user agent: `Zoiper rev.6751`

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240727191508.png)

	- However, we want the number that was dialed. This should be on an INVITE request.

```

	- On this first instance, the number that was dialed by extension '101' from 89.42.194.X:47357 is '900114382089'
	- At this point, we may want to find instances that exists AFTER this one


This is the most recent dialed number:

![](/assets/img/Pasted image 20240727191917.png)

<u>Query</u>:
```c
grep -Ei 'From: "Unknown"<sip:101' log.txt -B8 | grep INVITE
```

	- Extracts the regular expression enclosed in the single quotations.
	- '-B8' : this option tells 'grep' to show 8 lines of leading context before each matching line. Essentially, it includes the 8 lines preceding each match in the output.
	- Since we want to get the real-world phone numbers, it has to have the user agent of 'Zoiper rev.6751'


<u>Output</u>:
```c
INVITE sip:<number1>xxxx@honey.pot.IP.removed;transport=udp SIP/2.0 => Oldest
INVITE sip:<number2>xxxx@honey.pot.IP.removed;transport=udp SIP/2.0
INVITE sip:<number3>xxxx@honey.pot.IP.removed;transport=udp SIP/2.0 => Most recent
```

# Attack Chain

```c
1) Scan with NMAP on the PBX system''s server
2) Find configuration files in the PBX system''s Apache webserver for credentials
3) Run svwar to figure out which extension needs authentication and which does not
4) Use svcrack to register to the compromised extension
5) Attacker make phone calls on behalf of the victim''s phone number using actual VoIP number via Zoiper rev
6) With the prevalence of AI nowadays, attackers can do vishing attacks with the help of voice cloning and the receiver of the call would not know that they are talking to an attacker rather than their family or something.
```

	- Question: Can attacker relay the call received by the victim to themselves before the victim sees the call? If so, they can intercept the phone call and messages and possibly MiTM-ed it?
